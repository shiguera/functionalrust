  abstract = {Access to freeways is provided through interchanges to maintain the design concept of uninterrupted traffic flow. Therefore, provision of an appropriate entrance ramp and acceleration lane geometry that allows the entering vehicle to accelerate to a speed closer to the through lane speed is important for comfortable and safe merging maneuvers. In this paper, speed and traffic data were collected from 23 merging sites on Highway 417 located within the City of Ottawa, Canada, to study the traffic behavior at freeway merge areas. Analysis of traffic behavior showed that merging speed depends on both ramp and speed-change lane ͑SCL͒ geometrics. Lower merging speed was shown to be associated with higher collisions on the acceleration lanes. Right lane traffic volume and merging speed of entering vehicles were shown to significantly affect right lane speed along the acceleration lane. In addition, several statistically significant models were developed for the prediction of 85th percentile passenger car right lane speed, merging speed, merging distance, and acceleration on the SCL. A safety performance model was also developed to relate the total number of collisions on the acceleration SCL to the features of the merge area including the merging speed.},

This study aims to investigate the efficiency of 4 low-cost traffic calming measurements (TCM) at a simulated 1.5 km length of this rural highway as a representative. 39 participants with at least 3 years of driving experience took part in this study, and comparisons of driver behaviors in case of speed and lateral position as a safety index in 4 scenarios and base scenario were outputted. MANOVA analysis was conducted on speed and lateral position data outputted from the simulator device, at the entry into the urban community. Comparison of mean speed results obtained revealed that all 4 treatments significantly reduced the mean speed of drivers. In this respect, the benefits of modified road signs were proven to be as successful as road surface markings. As another criterion for safety, the investigation showed road signs and transverse rumble strips increased lateral position, but the pattern of peripheral hatched markings significantly reduced the lateral position. In case of speed reduction, maintaining the reduced speed is another issue that has been resulted that as soon as TCMs end up, the speed increases, however, does not reach the former values.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to further our understanding of the impact of a restricted field of view on visual search and hazard perception, by comparing novice and experienced driver performance in a driving simulator as a function of the available field of view. Participants encountered a series of virtual hazards during their drive while viewing the world under narrow or wide field of view conditions. The results showed that all drivers were more likely to avoid the hazards when presented with a wide view, even though the hazards only occurred in an area of the screen that was visible in both the wide and narrow view conditions. Experienced drivers also tended to have fewer crashes, and this appeared to be related to a greater speed reduction 10 metres before the hazard. This speed reduction was greatest in the wide field of view condition suggesting that additional information from wider eccentricities was useful in safely navigating the hazardous events. Gaze movement recording revealed that only experienced drivers made overt use of wider eccentricities, and this was typically in advance of any visual cues that might help identify the hazard. This suggests that either early overt attention to wider eccentricities, or continuous covert attention to these extra-foveal regions on approach to the hazard, is responsible for the safer behaviour of experienced drivers when presented with a wide field of view. We speculate about the possible underlying mechanism and discuss possible consequences for HP tests.},

This can be considered to be the product of two separate probabilities, the first being the probability that the gap between a pair of vehicles in the traffic stream is accepted, and the second the probability that the time needed to cross the on-coming stream of traffic causes the time-to-collision with the nearest vehicle in this traffic stream to be less than a second. The model is developed from the results of experimental trials involving a sample of drivers, the majority of whom were aged 60 years or older, in order to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on these probabilities. The parameters considered include the size of the gap between successive vehicles, vehicle characteristics such as size, colour and velocity, driver characteristics such as age and sex, and both daytime and night-time conditions. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Training results have been published previously that show some differences in performance between simulator configurations. Accident results were obtained for the teen drivers trained in this experiment from the Department of Motor Vehicles in the State of California, USA. The accident rate of the simulator trained subjects is compared with published California teen driver accident rates for the general state population and also published data from the Nova Scotia province of Canada. The accident rate of the teen driver subject population trained in the instrumented cab simulator configuration was only one third that of the general teen driver population. The accident rate of teen drivers trained with the desktop wide field of view configuration was 77\% of the general teen driver accident rate. The accident rate of the teen drivers trained on the single monitor desk top system was about equal to that of the general population. The paper describes the training regimens and simulator configurations and gives a detailed analysis of the accident data.},

However, widespread dissemination of these applications will require modest cost simulator systems. Low cost simulation is possible given the application of PC level technology, which is capable of providing reasonable fidelity in visual, auditory and control feel cuing. This paper describes a PC based simulation with high fidelity vehicle dynamics, which provides an easily programmable visual data base and performance measurement system, and good fidelity auditory and steering torque feel cuing. This simulation has been used in a variety of applications including screening truck drivers for the effects of fatigue, research on real time monitoring for driver drowsiness and measurement of the interference effect of in-vehicle IVHS tasks on driving performance. This paper discusses the characteristics of the simulation, including vehicle dynamics and visual, auditory and proprioceptive cueing and a unique scenario definition language (SDL) for defining driving scenarios and performance measurement. Potential low cost simulator applications are reviewed, along with issues of fidelity and validity.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a low cost, PC based driving simulation that includes a complete vehicle dynamics model (VDM), photo realistic visual display, torque feedback for steering feel and realistic sound generation. The VDM runs in real-time on Intel based PCs. The model, referred to as VDANL (Vehicle Dynamics Analysis, Non-Linear) has been developed and validated for a range of vehicles over the last decade and has been previously used for computer simulation analysis. The model's lateral and longitudinal dynamics have 17 degrees of freedom for a single unit vehicle and 33 degrees of freedom for an articulated vehicle. The model also includes a complete drive train including engine, transmission and front and rear drive differentials, and complete, power assisted braking and steering systems. A comprehensive tire model (STIREMOD) generates lateral and longitudinal forces and aligning torque based on normal load, camber angle and horizontal (lateral and longitudinal) slip. The tire model correctly simulates saturation and can represent off-road behavior including plowing in soft soil at high sideslip angles. The articulated vehicle can simulate tractor/trailer rigs, articulated buses and recreational/utility trailer setups. The visual system image generator (IG) is composed of a high speed graphics accelerator and Intel Pentium processor. The IG is capable of 800x600-pixel resolution, and three screens can be combined to give up to a 135-degree field of view. A head-mounted display can also be used to give an unlimited field of view. The visual scene rendering includes full texturing, Goraud shading, and dynamic lighting effects. The update rate is 30-60 Hz depending on scene complexity, and the IG can render at a rate of 1 million polygons/second. The time delay for display presentation is less than 100 msec., which presents minimal interference with driver closed loop control. Tire model aligning torque and a steering system model are used to compute steering torque commands which are then displayed to the driver with a torque motor applied to the simulator steering column The simulator VDM provides all outputs needed for driver cueing, including inertial outputs for commanding the IG, steering torque commands, various instrument commands, and auditory feedback. This paper summarizes the basic IG and VDM, means for generating and presenting cueing feedback to the driver, and a unique approach for easily creating and presenting driving scenarios. Several PC based driving simulation applications are also described, including a hardware-in-the-loop steering simulation, and desk top and cab simulations for use in research, rehabilitation, training and prototyping.

Results indicated that physical and functional fidelity were interdependent and that temporal measures were most sensitive to fidelity manipulations. Low functional fidelity was associated with longer problem solution and inter-response times.

Simulation sickness (SS) and the sense of presence (SP) are two well-known factors that could affect the results of the driving simulator experiments. This study investigated the relationship between SP and SS in a medium-fidelity driving simulator. Additionally, the impact of the road environment (urban arterials or rural expressways) on these subscales was investigated. Data was collected by means of self-reported questionnaires, which were conducted after the participants have driven the simulation scenarios in a fixed-base medium-fidelity driving simulator. A total of 125 drivers participated in this study. Results showed that females reported significantly higher SS scores than males. An increasing trend in the SS was observed with the increase of age. Importantly, designing buildings that replicate a real-world environment could increase SP and decrease SS. Moreover, designing high quality and resolution scenarios could also increase SP, thus decreasing the severity of SS symptoms. The results of this study can help researchers using medium-fidelity driving simulators to know the influencing factors for each subscale of SP on SS. Adjustments in the driving simulator and scenario settings as well as additional training exercises for higher speed scenarios can be beneficial in reducing the severity of SS.},

The proposed architecture is learnable from data and can reliably infer the current focus of attention of the driver in real-time, while only requiring limited and easy-to-access telemetry data from the vehicle. We build the proposed architecture on two core concepts: 1) driving can be modeled as a collection of sub-tasks (maneuvers), and 2) each sub-task affects the way a driver allocates visual attention resources, i.e., their eye gaze fixation. HammerDrive comprises two networks: a hierarchical monitoring network of forward-inverse model pairs for sub-task recognition and an ensemble network of task-dependent convolutional neural network modules for visual attention modeling. We assess the ability of HammerDrive to infer driver visual attention on data we collected from 20 experienced drivers in a virtual reality-based driving simulator experiment. We evaluate the accuracy of our monitoring network for sub-task recognition and show that it is an effective and light-weight network for reliable real-time tracking of driving maneuvers with above 90\% accuracy. Our results show that HammerDrive outperforms a comparable state-of-the-art deep learning model for visual attention prediction on numerous metrics with similar to 13\% improvement for both Kullback-Leibler divergence and similarity, and demonstrate that task-awareness is beneficial for driver visual attention prediction.},

These behavioural differences are probably due to curve-related dissimilarities with respect to geometric alignment, cross-sectional design and speed limit. TRS and HP both influenced mean speed and mean acceleration/deceleration but not lateral control. TRS generated an earlier and more stable speed reduction than HP which induced significant speed reductions along the curve. The TRS gives drivers more time to generate the right expectations about the upcoming curve. When accidents occur primarily near the curve entry, TRS is recommended. The HP has the potential to reduce accidents at the curve end.},

This study aims to make up for the lack of public research and accessibility because professional teams keep research to themselves or need too many people analysing data, as well as contributing to the initial development of a feedback system that fosters the performance improvement of sim racing drivers. This initial development is taking shape through interviews with sim racers and the creation of a data collection tool that is used to see how this data can be efficiently stored and used. The conclusion is comprised of a preliminary dashboard as a feedback system which is deemed more useful to sim racers as current feedback systems in place.},

Therefore, human behavior in curves needs to be corrected. Methodology: In this study, 2 different road marking treatments, optical circles and herringbone patterns, were used to influence driver behavior while entering a curve on a 2-lane rural road section. A driving simulator was used to perform the experiment. The simulated road sections are replicas of 2 real road sections in Flanders. Results: Both treatments were found to reduce speed before entering the curve. However, speed reduction was more gradual when optical circles were used. A herringbone pattern had more influence on lateral position than optical circles by forcing drivers to maintain a safe distance from opposing traffic in the adjacent lane. Conclusion: The study concluded that among other low-cost speed reduction methods, optical circles are effective tools to reduce speed and increase drivers' attention. Moreover, a herringbone pattern can be used to reduce crashes on curves, mainly for head-on crashes where the main problem is inappropriate lateral position.},

This simulator study aims to investigate how different music genres affect the driving behaviour of young drivers and their visual scanning of the environment in urban settings. The genres considered were Croatian pop, foreign pop, classical music, metal, and Balkan folk music, while on one road section there was no music. The research sample consisted of 61 participants (44 males and 17 females) with a mean age of 24.58 years and a mean driving experience of 5.25 years. The influence of music on the drivers' behaviour was analysed on the basis of the data collected from the driving simulator, eye tracking glasses, and structured observation during driving sessions. It was found that the highest average speed (around 60 km/h) was recorded while the participants were listening to Balkan folk and metal music, while other music genres, as well as the ``no music'' condition, influenced driving speed in a similar way to one another and the participants drove at 50 km/h on average. Furthermore, the results suggest that the music genre also affects how drivers visually scan the environment (the number of gazes classified as fixations and number of road signs looked at). The findings obtained may be used in road safety work and practical recommendations and further research are discussed.},

With GISsupported mapping of traffic accidents, we identified the most dangerous curves on the main rural road in Croatia and replicated them on the driving simulator. Based on the driving runs of 43 participants, the study concluded that both measures, used either alone or combined with a vertical warning sign, significantly reduced the speed compared to the control condition (vertical warning sign alone). Additionally, the use of a red median prompted the lateral movement of the vehicle closer to the edge line. The paper also defines the potential use of the measures for dealing with specific types of curve-related accidents.},

This was done so that the emergence of the pedestrian would be completely unsuspected. The subject drove in the right lane of the road at approximately 25 mph. When the subject was 82.5 ft. from the shed containing the pedestrian, a microswitch was tripped which released the dummy into the center of the road at a controlled rate. During the study a continuous record of speed, time, brake position, steering wheel position, lateral position of vehicle, longitudinal position of vehicle, and position of pedestrian was recorded. All of the subjects tried to avoid the pedestrian, either by brake application or by a steering change. Since this was a feasibility study with a small sample, no conclusions were drawn beyond the data, but the possibility of productive research in this area using simulation techniques seems to have been opened up.},

In the last 20 years, road design software (RDS) has been continuously updated with dedicated modules to estimate ASD, thus assessing the quality of project from a safety point of view. Unfortunately, the evaluation of ASD still represents an issue in the case of existing road, and the object of discussion in the research community. To avoid problems related to the limitation associated with the use of digital terrain models typically employed in RDS, the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software can use digital surface models (DSM) which are more flexible in the modelling of sight obstruction due to vegetation, street furniture, and vertical surfaces largely diffused in urbanized areas. The paper deals with the evaluation of GIS in the estimation of ASD in a typical urban road where the density of sight obstruction along the roadside is relatively high. The work explores the case study of a collector road in the city of Turin (Italy). Results confirm the potentiality of GIS software in capturing the complex morphology of the urban environment, thus confirming that GIS could become an important analysis tool for road engineers in the field of road safety. The investigation here described is part of the Pro-VISION Project (funded in 2014 by the Regione Piemonte, Italy).},

  abstract = {The available sight distance (ASD) is the maximum length of the roadway ahead visible to the driver. It is a fundamental factor in road geometry principles and is used by road designers to ensure safe driving conditions. However, designers do not know how a specific ASD may affect the longitudinal and transversal behavior of drivers engaged in negotiating curves. This paper focuses on analyzing driver longitudinal behavior along rural highways curves with limited visibility. A number of virtual sight condition scenarios were recreated and tested in the driving simulator. Three tracks were designed with various combinations of radii and sight obstructions (a continuous wall) along the roadside located at various offsets from the lane centerline, combinations which resulted with a minimum ASD of 56.6 m. Roadside factors capable of influencing the risk perception of drivers (e.g., traffic barriers, posted speed limit signs, vegetation) were all excluded from the simulations. Results indicate that speed and trajectory dispersion from the lane centerline depend linearly on ASD in the investigated range of curve radii (from 120 to 430 m). In general, when ASD increases, so does speed and the trajectories tend to be less dispersed around the lane centerline. As a result, in safety terms, any variation in ASD will have the polar opposite effect on safety related parameters. Furthermore, different curves with similar ASD values resulted in different speed and lateral control behaviors. Analysis from ANOVA support the same findings; in addition, radius, curve direction, and distance from trajectory to sight obstruction have been identified as significant independent parameters. Road designers should adjust the ASD and these parameters when seeking to encourage drivers to adopt appropriate behaviors. To optimize safe driving conditions, ASD should be designed so that it is slightly greater than the required sight distance, since excessive ASD values may encourage drivers to drive at inappropriate speeds.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the behaviours adopted by road users when negotiating horizontal curves with sight limitations. Experiments at a driving simulator were conducted on two-lane highways in which drivers were confronted with a range of sight conditions generated by the manipulation of variables such as curve direction, radii and distance of lateral sight obstructions along horizontal curves. It was observed that most of the drivers adopted strategies which resulted in a stopping distance shorter than the available sight distance, thereby maintaining safe driving conditions. Some drivers reduced their speed, some increased the lateral distance from any sight obstructions along the roadside, some did both, while others did neither. A preliminary analysis indicated that the safety benefits resulting from a vehicle speed reduction strategy significantly outweigh those from a lateral shift in the lane. Further analyses on the 1246 cases investigated offered further support for this proposition, while revealing that a higher proportion of drivers opted for the first strategy for safety reasons. Moreover, visibility conditions (safe, partially safe, and unsafe) played a role in the choice of driving strategies. Results provide evidence that a significant group of drivers used the two strategies under severely restricted visibility conditions (i.e., along sharp radius curves); however, the strategies selected were independent of the driver speed profile (i.e., slower, average, or faster).},

  abstract = {Variable Message Signs (VMS) provide real-time information on traffic conditions, making it possible to guide drivers through electronic signs along the road. Relevant literature has proved VMS to be effective, especially for diverting traffic during incidents in the highway or inducing a speed reduction. Previous efforts, however, usually involve off-highway experiences, including the use of simulators or stated preference surveys, or the measurement of aggregate values of traffic through technologies that are prone to a higher failure rate, such as loop detectors. For bridging this gap, in this research, we propose a novel vehicle-by-vehicle approach (VBV), that differentiate by vehicle type, to assess the impact of VMS on drivers' road behavior patterns along a section of a Chilean urban highway during risky situations. In addition to the messaging in\- formation, we use full traffic data obtained from free-flow gates equipped with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology. We conduct statistical analyses to study two potential messaginginduced behavioral changes, namely speed reduction and lane changes. For the speed reduction behavior, in 87.50\% of the studied messages, the results indicate that the messages failed to induce the desired change in behavior. This value decreases to 71.85\% for lane changes. The results indicate that heavy vehicle drivers and low-mileage drivers are more likely to follow lane change messages.},

  abstract = {Problem Accident statistics demonstrate that there should be a greater focus on nighttime driving to improve our knowledge of driver behavior under poor lighting conditions. However, the current geometric design criteria do not take into account driving at night. Moreover, studies that propose predictive models of operating speed only consider daytime driving conditions. Method This study compares driver speed behavior during daytime and nighttime driving and models operating speeds and speed differentials, identifying significant factors that influence speed behavior under different lighting conditions. The research was carried out using a driving simulator for a section of an existing two-lane rural road composed of 39 tangent-curve configurations. Speed profiles were recorded for 40 drivers under simulated daytime and nighttime driving conditions. Results New predictive speed models, differentiated for daytime and nighttime driving, are proposed that highlight the effects of different geometric predictors under different visibility conditions. Specifically, predictive models for operating speed on curves identified the inverse of the radius and the deflection angle of the curve as predictors under both driving conditions. For speed differentials based on the 85th percentile for maximum speed reduction (85MSR), we found that the inverse of the approaching tangent length and of the curve radius significantly explained the dependent variable in both cases, with a higher dependence of nighttime 85MSR on the curve geometry than on the tangent length. Tangent length had a significant effect on operating speed for independent tangents only for the daytime model, whereas the inverse of the previous radius was confirmed as a predictor for both visibility conditions. Practical applications This research may influence design considerations for nighttime driving by providing evidence of the effects of nighttime conditions on driver speed choices and road safety. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A two-lane rural road lined with trees was designed and implemented in an advanced-interactive driving simulator. Two different cross-sections (with and without a shoulder), which were combined with three roadside configurations (only trees, trees and barriers, trees and barriers having undergone a treatment), were tested. Six road scenarios were then analyzed. Thirty-six drivers (33 were deemed to be valid and used for the analysis) drove in the simulator using these scenarios and the speed and lateral placement values were collected. Statistical analysis showed that the driver behavior was only affected by the cross-sections and geometric elements but not by roadside configurations. Although the presence of trees along the road represents a factor that increases the severity of run-off-road accidents, drivers do not change their behavior when barriers are not present. Concerning the effects of the beginning of the barrier, MANOVA revealed a main effect for roadside configuration on lateral position but not on speed. There was also a clear tendency of drivers to "cut" both the right curves as well as the left curves in order to minimize the speed reduction in the tangent-curve-tangent transition. These main results allow useful suggestions to be made as regards safety measures for improving road safety on two-lane rural roads lined with trees. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Speeds were recorded at eleven measurement sites with different alignment configurations on a two-lane rural road near Rome. The real world was reproduced in the CRISS driving simulator. Forty drivers drove the simulator. The results of the comparative and statistical analysis established the relative validity and also revealed that absolute validity was obtained in nine measurements sites. Only in two non-demanding configurations, were the speeds in simulator significantly higher than those recorded in the field. In these sites the mean speed in simulator was equal to or greater than 94 km/h. For these configurations, the higher speeds recorded in simulator appeared to stem from the different risk perception on the simulated road as opposed to that on the real road. The study's results should be considered for driving speed behavior research, in which simulator equipment with similar features of the CRISS driving simulator is used. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The results of a virtual reality experimental survey, aimed at evaluating how cross-section width affects driver s behavior, are reported. Two two-lane rural roads were implemented in an interactive driving simulator. Each one is characterized by a different cross section width but same alignment. The configurations of the surveyed cross sections were those recommended by the Italian technical regulation for rural roads (type C1) and for local roads (type F2). The alignment was designed with tangents, clothoids and curves. 64 drivings were performed. Four parameters were determined on each geometrical element of the alignment with different cross section width: average speed, range of speed, average trajectory and range of lateral position on cross section. The narrowing of the cross section width causes the decrease of speed but does not alter the way the driver adjusts his speed driving from a design elements to another along the alignment. The adjustment of the speed is therefore affected exclusively by the geometry of the axis of the alignment. The values of speed obtained indicate that the assumption of the same maximum design speed (Vdmax) for the design of alignments with different cross section width determines a degree of safety, with respect to the stopping maneuver, that is inferior in alignments with a wider section. With respect to the values collected on cross section C1, on the cross section F2 a greater dispersion of speed and a greater number of cases of occupation of the shoulder and of the opposite lane (an event which was never recorded in section C1), were recorded. The importance of the shoulder in the driver s choice of lateral position and his propensity to drive near the axis of the space he perceives as utilizable, consisting of the lane and shoulder, was confirmed.},

Speed measurements were conducted with a laser speed meter in the transition area, the activity area, and the termination area, and in the advance warning area speeds were shot with a camera from an overpass. Speed data from the field and the simulator were analyzed by using the bilateral Z-test for nonmatched samples to determine whether drivers responded differently in the simulator compared with their response during the real driving experience.

The current study tests the combined effects of three roadway design elements - shoulders width, guardrail existence and roadway geometry (curvature) - on objective driving measures (speed and lane position), and subjective measures (perceived safe driving speed and estimated road safety). Twenty two drivers participated in an experiment with a driving simulation. In the first part objective driving data were collected, and in the second part subjective paper-pencil evaluations were requested of the perceived safety of 30 different scenarios that were previously experienced in the simulator. The scenarios consisted of the various combinations of the three roadway design elements. The results showed a significant effect of roadway geometry on both objective and subjective measures. The shoulders width had a significant effect on actual speed, on lane position, and on perceived safe driving speed, but only when a guardrail was present. These findings illustrate the perceptual role of a guardrail in defining the perceived safety margins that various shoulder widths provide. When a guardrail is absent, the width of the shoulder loses much of its benefits and effects on driving behavior. The results also demonstrate that roadway geometry can be used to reduce driving speeds, but at the same time it can have a negative effect on maintaining a stable lane position in sharp curves. Thus, controlling the width of road shoulders and the placement of guardrails seems to be a safer approach to speed and lane position control. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A community sample of older adults completed a battery of cognitive measures, several self-reported driving measures, and a novel driving simulator task (AC). Simple attention, executive functioning, and processing speed were associated with simulator performance variables. Lower self-rated driving safety was associated with slower simulated driving. Additionally, several cognitive domains were associated with perceptions about driving-related safety and driving-related legal repercussions (e.g., traffic tickets). Findings suggested that associations between cognitive tests with AC were less robust than those found in other simulator studies. Novel associations between cognitive performance and self-reported driving were identified; however, given the small sample size of this study, such associations should be explored further.},

For studies conducted in highway work zones, the availability of safe vantage points for data collection at critical locations can be a significant challenge. A validation framework is therefore proposed in this paper, demonstrated using a fixed-based DS that addresses the issue by using a global positioning system (GPS). Methods: The validation of the DS was conducted using objective and subjective evaluations. The objective validation was divided into qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The DS was validated by comparing the results of simulation with the field data, which were collected using a GPS along the highway and video recordings at specific locations in a work zone. The constructed work zone scenario in the DS was subjectively evaluated with 46 participants. Results: The objective evaluation established the absolute and relative validity of the DS. The mean speeds from the DS data showed excellent agreement with the field data. The subjective evaluation indicated realistic driving experience by the participants. Practical applications: The use of GPS showed that continuous data collected along the highway can overcome the challenges of unavailability of safe vantage points especially at critical locations. Further, a validated DS can be used for examining driver behavior in complex situations by replicating realistic scenarios.},

  abstract = {Driver Performance Model (DPM) development has provided results reflecting on the debate between on-road and driving-simulator data in driving research. Developed for FHWA, DPM is a computational micro-process model of driver behavior that has been designed to simulate---in detail---the driver's perceptual, cognitive, and control processes to generate steering, braking, and acceleration inputs to the vehicle. The requirement to develop driver data for prediction of absolute on-road performance---versus typical interest in ordinal findings to be later validated via on-road studies---led to the collection of comparable on-road and simulator data and their subsequent comparison. Comparisons of corresponding curve-entry speeds and speed profiles revealed a profound divergence between the on-road and simulator results ( t = 9.39, p {$<$} .005). Compared with simulator drivers, on-road drivers tended to have higher curve-entry speeds for the more difficult (sharper) curves and lower speeds for the less difficult curves. This trend, though reduced in magnitude, was apparent even after statistical adjustments for differences in respective tangent speeds ( t = 2.67, p {$<$} .01). These results are discussed in light of emerging on-road and simulator capabilities. The discussion and earlier results altogether supported two conclusions: ( a) debate concerning on-road versus simulator research studies is likely to continue with their rapidly emerging individual capabilities, and ( b) on-road research currently provides the best basis for driver model development where one-to-one real-world predictions are required (e.g., DPM).},

It focuses mainly on driving simulator validation studies with regard to driver behaviour. Various approaches, methodologies and criteria have been proposed until today regarding the behavioral and physical validation of a driving simulator. At the same time, a number of behavioural validation studies have been conducted, with or without taking into account the proposed validation approaches. The author considered necessary this literature review because according to her knowledge there was no other published review which examined thoroughly the link between theory (proposed validation approaches and methodologies) and practice (validation studies cc driving simulators). Most of the recent behaviour validation studies have been focused on the absolute and relative validity of the simulator without taking into consideration the issue of the face validity. The format of this paper will be as follows. A small introduction to driving simulators and their usefulness will be presented first followed by the necessity of validating them. The existing validation approaches, methodologies and criteria will be analysed and earlier and recent behaviour validation studies will be reviewed and compared in detail. These studies will be classified according to the driver behaviour levels and driving performance (as they will be defined) and then will be assessed according to the validation criteria. Emphasis will be given to the interpretation of the findings from these comparisons, and in particular to their applicability in real road traffic situations.},

In every round, the learner suffers some loss and receives some feedback based on the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize her cumulative loss. Applications range from dynamic pricing to label-efficient prediction to dueling bandits. In this paper, we assume that we are given some prior information about the distribution based on which the opponent generates the outcomes. We propose BPM, a family of new efficient algorithms whose core is to track the outcome distribution with an ellipsoid centered around the estimated distribution. We show that our algorithm provably enjoys near-optimal regret rate for locally observable partial-monitoring problems against stochastic opponents. As demonstrated with experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data, the algorithm outperforms previous approaches, even for very uninformed priors, with an order of magnitude smaller regret and lower running time.},

  abstract = {Several factors can influence driver behaviour, and road geometry is one of them. A better understanding of driver-roadway interaction can enhance road design to create a safer traffic system. In this context, driving simulators are powerful tools that combine convenience and effectiveness in identifying drivers' responses to different geometry factors. In this paper, a systematic review following a Prisma guideline was conducted on driving simulator studies that examined the effects of road geometry on driver behaviour to reveal the current procedures adopted in this field and their main findings. A systematic search of eleven databases was performed covering six years of research results. Inclusion of relevant studies focused on horizontal curves, a topic identified as the most cited, extended this period. The results revealed significant heterogeneity in relation to the measured variables and deficiencies when reporting the experiment, which prevented a meta-analysis of the studies' outcomes. Despite this, a discussion of the potential of driving simulators to contribute to several road safety research gaps is presented. In addition, problems of a lack of standardisation in the performance of the exper\- iments were detected, potentially influencing the findings of the studies. However, the results also suggest that experiments that followed good experimental practices observed effects on driver performances not detected by other studies.},

  abstract = {Several studies have often cited crash occurrences as a motivation to perform a driving simulator experiment and test driver behavior to understand their causal relations. However, decisions regarding the simulated scenario and participants' requirements do not often rely directly on traffic crash data. To fill the gap between simulation and real data, we have proposed a new framework based on Clustering Analysis (K-medoids) to support the definition of driving simulator experiments when the purpose is to investigate the driver behavior under real risky road conditions to improve road safety. The suggested approach was tested with data of three years of police records regarding loss-of-control crashes and information on three Brazilian rural highways' geometry and traffic volume. The results showed the good suitability of the method to compile the data's diversity into four clusters, representing and summarizing the crashes' main characteristics in the region of study. Drivers' attri\- butes (age and gender) were initially intended to integrate the clustering analysis; however, due to the sample's homogeneity of these characteristics, they did not contribute to the cluster definition. Hence, they were used simply to identify the target population for all scenarios. Therefore, we concluded that driving simulator ex\- periments could benefit from the new approach since it identifies scenarios characterized by many variables connected to real risky situations and orients participants' recruitment leading to efficient safety analysis.},

  abstract = {Driving simulators offer many advantages over reality when studying driving behavior. Repeatability of experimental conditions, safety, and cost are some of the motivating factors for using simulators. A relevant research question is to what degree drivers' behavior observed in driving simulators is a reflection of how they drive in reality. To study this question of transfer in a meaningful manner, a means to quantify driver behavior in an insight-providing manner is needed, as is a means to match experimental conditions between simulation and reality. The often used time averages and standard deviations of vehicle state variables (e.g. lateral position and speed) and/or driver control variables (e.g. steering wheel angle and pedal depression) are inadequate characterizations of driving behavior because they are too far removed from the perceptual cues that shape driving behavior and the way drivers evaluate driving performance. Drivers are hypothesized to base their control and decision-making on a set of perceptual variables (e.g. splay-rate, bearing-to-tangent-point, time-to-collision, and time-to-tangent-point) and to constrain their behavior such that several time-based safety-margins are satisfied (e.g. time-to-line-crossing, and time-headway). We propose an evaluation of driving behavior based on our perceptually plausible and cognitively feasible driver model and to apply it to assess behavioral difference between driving simulators and reality.},

  abstract = {The role of road markings is fundamental for traffic safety, as it represents an essential optical driving instrument both for effective drivers and autonomous vehicles. This research aims to evaluate the effects of the decay of road marking visibility along curves, specifically the variability in lateral acceleration. Traditionally, issues related to the correct interpretation of a road alignment were studied by means of trajectory analyses. However, they involved information about the vehicle's geometrical position without any indication on dynamics. To explore this aspect further, an experiment in a simulated environment involving 21 drivers was performed. They drove along a test road in a standardized scenario considering only three variables: the curve direction (right or left), the deviation angle (70{$^\circ$} or 30{$^\circ$}), and the road marking visibility percentage (100\%, 50\%, 10\%, and 0\%). The results, in differences between theoretical (depending on design speed and curve radius) and effective lateral accelerations, provide further evidence of the strategic role of the markings. However, when markings deteriorate, drivers activate some balancing mechanisms to mitigate the dynamic effects along curves and, in turn, to improve comfort and safety. The proposed procedure is not only of direct practical interest, but it is also fully generalizable to other contexts and issues, involving several other elements that may influence the phenomenon, such as road geometry, visibility conditions, and traffic flow speed.},

The present research aimed to reveal factors that govern car following under conditions of reduced visibility.

At the higher speed, fog conditions separated participants into a group that stayed within visible range of the lead car, even though the headway time violated the NHTSA recommendations for the speed involved, and another group that lagged beyond the visible range. Data were compared to the model of Van Winsum for car following (The human element in car following models. Transportation Research Part F 2, 1999).

Two questionnaires have been used to acquire demographic information about the participants and help control for factors such as experience. Quantitative results show that there is an improvement for the group using the feedback system, although this improvement dissipates when the feedback is disabled again for the experimental group. Analysis of the initial results are encouraging, with the model showing promise. Additionally, the lack of cognitive retention on behalf of the participants when feedback was disabled merits further investigation and future work.},

This paper describes a study focusing on one specific hardware variable, that is, whether or not to use a real car cabin. Eighteen participants drove on two separate occasions within a fixed-base driving simulator and at specific points were requested to carry out secondary tasks. Participants conducted one drive in an "in-car" set up incorporating the body shell of a real car, and a second in an "out-of-car" set up incorporating only a car dashboard. Results indicated that the real car set up was associated with a more conservative driving style. This was particularly the case when drivers were performing secondary tasks concurrently with primary driving tasks. Furthermore, there was evidence that drivers within a real car exhibited greater situational awareness than those in the "out-of-car" set up. Finally, the research indicated that the experience of simulator sickness may be moderated by enclosure within a real car cabin.},

  abstract = {Visibility is a critical factor for drivers to perceive roadway information, and fog is an inclement weather condition that directly impacts their vision, since it reduces both overall contrast and visibility of the driving scene. Visual attention has been considered a contributing factor to traffic crashes, and fog-related accidents are prone to be more severe and involve multiple vehicles. The literature lacks studies on the influence of fog on drivers' visual performance and environment's infrastructure design. This article investigates the effects of fog on drivers' performance in a Brazilian curved road segment through a driving simulator experiment -- more precisely, whether the presence of fog (foggy scenario) or its absence (clear scenario) significantly affects the visual profile. In the foggy scenario, the results showed the tracked area was concentrated in a smaller region, despite an increase in the number of fixations compared with the clear scenario. The fixation duration did not change between the scenarios and the pupil dilation was shorter in the foggy one. The study shows the influence of environmental conditions on the driver's performance and is one of the first on the use of driving simulators with realistic representations of the road infrastructure and its surrounding for the understanding of driving under fog in the Brazilian scenario. Besides roadway geometry elements, driving simulator studies enable analyses of features related to the interaction between route environment and driver's answer, and can improve safety in places with visibility problems caused by fog, reducing their environmental impact and preserving drivers' lives.},

This study evaluates the driver's speed profile in different scenarios (clear weather, fog weather, and fog with an in-vehicle fog warning system) considering the road geometry elements (s-curves). A driving simulator recreated the real scenarios of a principal Brazilian road segment, showing the geometric and weather conditions of a road known for its several s-curves and frequent incidence of fog. A preliminary study identified the most critical curves through a weighted severity index methodology to define the critical segment. The results showed drivers considerably reduced their speed in the scenario with a warning system, thus contributing to the safety of s-curved segments. The implementation of in-vehicle warning systems can avoid or reduce the need for major infrastructure interventions such as geometric design, through investments in new intelligent transport systems.},

In a driving simulation, 44 participants drove along seven roadside tree configurations. The configurations were characterized by two offsets of trees from the road edge (1.5 and 4.0 m) and three spacings between trees (10.0, 17.5, and 25.0 m) located on the roadside of a two-lane rural road that was 6.0 m wide. One additional confguration, without trees, was used as the baseline condition. The investigation was developed over five geometric elements: sharp left curve, sharp right curve, gentle left curve, gentle right curve, and tangent. Compared with the baseline condition, when trees were close to the road edge, drivers were found to decrease their speed significantly and move toward the centerline of the road. By contrast, when the offset of trees was increased, drivers adopted higher speeds that increased the distance from the road edge but with a lower left lateral displacement. This occurred along all five geometries, especially on sharp curves. Tree spacing did not affect the drivers' speed but significantly influenced the lateral position: drivers moved farther away from the road edge when tree spacing was decreased. The results demonstrated that drivers balanced the useful guidance information that roadside trees provided with the risk associated with the presence of trees: when trees were far away, the sense of guidance was predominant, and drivers adopted higher speeds; when trees were closer, drivers saw the trees as a risk, slowed down, and moved further away from them. Such driving behavior has direct impacts on the safety implications of roadside trees.},

For this purpose, an experimental activity was carried out on ninety participants. Specifically, the driving performance along exit and entry maneuvers, from the roadway to service areas and vice versa, was recorded in real and simulated scenarios using an instrumented vehicle and a driving simulator, where an exact representation of the existing roadway was reproduced. Validation of the driving simulator was performed by comparing field and simulation data in terms of driving speeds and trajectories of two driver samples. The main results demonstrated the relative and absolute validity of the simulator for deceleration and acceleration lanes to/from service areas. The promising results of the study allowed the authors to advance to the next step of the project, in which several scenarios will be reproduced in the virtual environment, with varying boundary conditions, namely the volume of diverging vehicles, lane lengths, and ramp locations.

  abstract = {Objective: Speed has been identified as a key risk factor in road crashes, influencing the occurrence of a road crash and its severity. Excessive speeding is particularly dangerous on highway curves, and under critical traffic and environmental conditions. Various measures have been identified to be effective in managing and controlling vehicle speed. Among these, low-cost perceptual measures have been considered to be effective tools, as they generally increase the risks perceived by drivers, or alter speed perception, and consequently lead the drivers to reduce their speeds. The overall aim of this study is 1) to investigate the effectiveness of a set of perceptual treatments in reducing the driver's speed along a sharp curve of an existing rural road that is characterized by high crash rates, and 2) to identify the most effective measure(s) to implement in the field to counteract the problem of speeding. Methods: A driving simulator study was developed and four speed-reducing measures (white and red peripheral transverse bars (PTB), optical speed bars (OSB) and chevrons) were tested on a sample of forty-two drivers. The driving speeds recorded using the treatments tests were compared to a baseline condition (treatments were not applied). Subjective measures were also collected; these included the driver's evaluation of the desired speed, risk perception, road legibility, and markings comprehension, as based on screenshot pictures that represented the simulated configurations of the treatments. Results: The outcomes demonstrated an overall effectiveness of the perceptual treatments. Particularly, red PTB were associated with a speed-reduction of up to 12 km/h along the curve under study. An analysis of the questionnaires revealed that drivers did not fully comprehend the relevant message of PTB. Despite that, the drivers did unconsciously reduce their speeds; this confirms the effectiveness of such perceptual treatments based on the optical illusion that entices drivers to reduce their speeds. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the perceptual treatments, especially red PTB, in enticing drivers to reduce their speeds whilst approaching the sharp curve under study or driving through the curve.},

  abstract = {Left-turns are some of the most dangerous maneuvers drivers face as they involve a complex decision-making process. Indeed, drivers must wait for an adequate gap in oncoming traffic to safely complete a left-turn ma\- neuver. In this context, incorrectly assessed gaps can lead to severe crashes and severe traffic delays at in\- tersections. This study tests the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, built into connected vehicle technology, to improve the safety of left-turn maneuvers of connected vehicles by adding visual virtual infor\- mation to the driver. To achieve this goal, a driving simulator study was carried out. The effectiveness of the system was tested, and the ability of young drivers to detect adequate gaps between vehicles in the opposite lane (with right of way) to safely turn left was assessed with and without AR warnings at a two-way stop-controlled intersection under a connected vehicles environment. In the scenario projected on the simulation screen, three different virtual warnings were displayed and tested: a green/red traffic light, which informs the driver of the availability of an appropriate gap between opposing vehicles; a traffic light with a timer showing the number of seconds available to safely perform the left-turn maneuver; a traffic light with an additionally activated audio warning system. Significant positive effects of AR warnings on driving performance and traffic safety were observed: the number of safe left-turns increased and the delays at the intersection decreased. In addition, AR signaling improved driving behavior both during the waiting time, with many more drivers waiting for the gap in front of the stop line to avoid disrupting oncoming traffic, and turning movement, reducing the average time it took to complete the left-turn maneuver. This study confirmed the great potential of AR and connected vehicle technologies to improve general safety conditions on the road network, especially under risky situations and difficult maneuvers.},

Speed differential parameters are commonly used for design consistency evaluation, according to an advanced approach of road engineering, based on the study of the roadway's conformance to driver expectancy that can improve road safety performance. The research was carried out using a driving simulator where a section of 10 km of an existing two-lane rural road composed by 39 tangent-curve configurations was implemented. The speed profiles of 40 drivers were recorded both in simulated daylight and nightlight driving conditions. The study proposes new relationships between speed differential parameters for different visibility condition and geometries of tangent-curve configurations and increases the actual knowledge of driver's speed choices and driving behaviour under nighttime conditions. Specifically, results demonstrate different relations between speed differential parameters among four different classes of tangent-curve geometries and under day and night driving conditions. Relations are also compared with the main literature models that correlated speed differential parameters.},

  abstract = {Several studies have indicated that road crashes are more likely to occur on horizontal curves than on straight roadway segments for a good number of reasons, the most important of which is associated with the driver's behavior along the curve depending on his or her perception of the road geometry. However, the evaluation of the effects of curve features on driving performance still remains a critical issue for road safety and design. The main objective of this study is to investigate driver's behavior and his perception of road curves, which is directly related to road safety. Specifically, the effects of some curve features (radius, transition curve, visibility, cross-section) on driving performance are investigated through a multifactorial experiment based on driving simulation. The driving speeds and trajectories of a sample of 34 drivers were statistically processed over 72 different curves distributed along three test scenarios. The main and interaction effects of the independent variables are described and discussed in the Results section providing a significant improvement of the actual knowledge in this field of research. In general, the results confirm that driving simulation can disclose the relationships between road design features and driver behavioral aspects that are crucial issues in creating a safer road infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Driving simulators are powerful tools for use in research and applications concerned with the evaluation and improvement of driving performance. The value of this technology is contingent upon carefully considering the technical features of the simulator itself (e.g., type of visual display, vehicle control model), the development of appropriate hypothesis-motivated driving scenarios, and the selection of meaningful outcome measures with respect to the questions being addressed and the populations of interest. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute's iDAPT Centre for Rehabilitation Research recently developed DriverLab, a 7 degrees-of-freedom, motion-based simulator, containing a passenger vehicle, 360 degree visual projection screen, and unique rain and glare simulators (www.idapt.com). To maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the research conducted within this unique facility, a workshop was organized during which experts across several fields (academia, clinical, industry, government) met in four separate groups to discuss four targeted themes including: (1) use of simulators for driving assessment; (2) effects of drugs on driving safety; (3) effects of automated vehicle technologies (AVTs; e.g., adaptive cruise control) on driving safety; and (4) techniques for mitigating simulator sickness. This paper describes the consensus achieved by the driving assessment group. The driving assessment group was specifically tasked with characterizing the role of driving simulators in assessing driving performance across a range of applications and populations including individuals with sensory, motor, or cognitive impairments, psychiatric disorders and neurological disorders. The group includes experts in driving evaluations of medically-at-risk drivers (Hyde); clinical assessment of fitness-to-drive (Hebert, Naglie, Law, Classen); and researchers studying the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional factors associated with driving performance and/or simulation design (B{\'e}dard, Classen, Campos, Hebert, Yung). The team also includes representation by government organizations that employ a large workforce of occupational drivers (Canada Post) and those involved in road safety initiatives.},

In this paper, we investigate how to transfer driving behaviors from The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) to VDrift, which are two well known open-source racing games featuring rather different physics engines and game dynamics. We focus on a neuroevolution learning framework based on NEAT and compare three different methods of transfer learning: (i) transfer of the learned behaviors; (ii) transfer of the learning process; (iii) transfer of both the behaviors and the process. Our experimental analysis suggests that all the proposed methods of transfer learning might be effectively applied to boost the learning of driving behaviors in VDrift by exploiting the knowledge previously learned in TORCS. In particular, transferring both learned behaviors and learning process appears to be the best trade-off between the final performance and the computational cost. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

It consists of a constrained optimization problem where the objective function is given by a line integral along the layout. The integrand is a function representing the cost of the road going through each point and, by considering different costs, a wide range of problems can be included in this formulation. To show it, we apply this methodology to three different situations. The two first cases are related with the design of a new road layout and used to solve a pair of academic examples. The third problem deals with the improvement of a road adapting the old path to current legislation, and it is solved taking as case study the reconstruction project for a regional road (NA-601) in the north of Spain.},

  abstract = {As one of the main elements of geometric design, sight distance must be considered carefully for the safe and efficient operation of highways. An application developed on geographic information systems (GIS) was conceived for the three-dimensional estimation of sight distance on highways, as opposed to conventional two-dimensional techniques, which may underestimate or overestimate the actual visibility conditions. It is capable of computing the available sight distance of a highway section given the driver's eye height, the target height, the vehicle path and an elevation model. The outcome can be studied in detail with the aid of the tools and capabilities developed, including sight-distance graphs. The influence of the input features, such as the nature of the elevation model, its resolution and the spacing between path stations on the results accuracy was analyzed. The interpretation of results is also essential to explain sight distance deficiencies and provide insight into the effect of roadside elements on those results. In addition, the sight-distance graph permits the detection and characterization of sight-hidden dips, an undesirable shortcoming in the spatial alignment of highways. The versatility of GIS enables, moreover, an integrated research of highway safety. It allows the incorporation of diverse operational factors such as accident data, traffic volume, operating speed and design consistency to detect and diagnose potentially hazardous spots or, eventually, identify the factors involved in a particular accident. This paper describes the methodology utilized and reviews the main issues through case study examples.},

Three high resolution DTMs, based on airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), are used. Vehicle path is collected by a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) mounted in a vehicle travelling along the road. Twelve combinations of DTM resolution and distance between calculation points along the vehicle path are studied. Results are statistically analysed and each case study is compared to a reference case which is considered close to reality. The analysis made shows that DTM resolution has a larger effect on the quality of the results than distance between calculation points. Practical issues are discussed.},

  abstract = {Horizontal curves have been recognized as a significant safety issue for many years, a more important factor than road width or sight distance. The research literature suggests that driver errors associated with horizontal curves result from three inter-related problems: failures of driver attention, misperceptions of speed and curvature, and poor lane positioning. To examine the roles of attentional, perceptual, and lane placement factors in driver behaviour at curves, two groups of curve treatments were identified for testing with a driving simulator. The first group of treatments consisted of four combinations of warning signs designed to alert drivers to the presence of curves and produce a reduction in curve approach speeds. The second group was comprised of several types of road markings designed to affect drivers' speed and lane position as they drove through curves. The results indicated that advance warning signs by themselves were not as effective at reducing speeds as when they were used in conjunction with chevron sight boards and/or repeater arrows. Of the road marking treatments only rumble strips produced any appreciable reductions in speed. A herringbones road marking was found to produce significant improvements in drivers' lane positions, effectively flattening the drivers' paths through the curves. A treatment combining the herringbones treatment with chevron and repeater arrow signs produced both a reliable reduction in speed as well as improved lane positions. The results are interpreted as evidence that treatments that highlight perceptual cues are the most effective means of moderating drivers' curve speeds.},

Two types of experimental road markings, an ``Attentional'' set designed to provide visually distinct cues to indicate speed limits of 60, 80 and 100 km/h, and a ``Perceptual'' set designed to also affect drivers' perception of speed, were compared to a standard undifferentiated set of markings. Participants (n = 20 per group) were assigned to one of four experimental groups (Attentional-Explicit, Attentional-Implicit, Perceptual-Explicit, Perceptual-Implicit) or a Control group (n = 22; standard road markings). The Explicit groups were instructed about the meaning of the road markings while those in the Implicit and Control groups did not receive any explanation. Participants drove five 10 km simulated roads containing three speed zones (60, 80 and 100 km/h) during the first session. The participants returned to the laboratory approximately 3 days later to drive five more trials including roads they had not seen before, a trial that included a secondary task, and a trial where speed signs were removed and only markings were present. The findings indicated that both types of road markings improved drivers' compliance with speed limits compared to the control group, but that explicit instruction as to the meaning of the markings was needed to realise their full benefit. Although previous research has indicated the benefit of road markings used as warnings to indicate speed reductions in advance of horizontal or vertical curves, the findings of the present experiment also suggest that systematically associating road markings with specific speed limits may be a useful way to improve speed limit compliance and increase speed homogeneity.},

  abstract = {Purpose. Driving is a complex behavior that requires the utilization of a wide range of individual abilities. Identifying assessments that not only capture individual differences, but also are related to older adults' driving performance would be beneficial. This investigation examines the relationship between the Useful Field of View (UFOV) assessment and objective measures of retrospective or concurrent driving performance, including state-recorded accidents, on-road driving, and driving simulator performance. Method. The PubMed and PsycINFO data-bases were searched to retrieve eight studies that reported bivariate relationships between UFOV and these objective driving measures. Cumulative meta-analysis techniques were used to combine the effect sizes in an attempt to determine whether the strength of the relationship was stable across studies and to assess whether a sufficient number of studies have been conducted to validate the relationship between UFOV and driving performance. Results. A within-group homogeneity of effect sizes test revealed that the samples could be thought of as being drawn from the same population, Q [7] = 11.29, p (one-tailed) = 0.13. Therefore, the effect sizes of eight studies were combined for the present cumulative meta-analysis. The weighted mean effect size across the studies revealed a large effect (Cohen's d = 0.945), with poorer UFOV performance associated with negative driving outcomes. This relationship was robust across multiple indices of driving performance and several research laboratories. Conclusions. This convergence of evidence across numerous studies using different methodologies confirms the importance of the UFOV assessment as a valid and reliable index of driving performance and safety. Recent prospective studies have confirmed a relationship between UFOV performance and future crashes, further supporting the use of this instrument as a potential screening measure for at-risk older drivers.

  abstract = {Speed perception is an important task depending mainly on optic flow that the driver must perform continuously to control his/her vehicle. Unfortunately, it appears that in some driving simulators speed perception is under estimated, leading into speed production higher than in real conditions. Perceptual validity is then not good enough to study driver's behavior. To solve this problem, a technique has recently seen the light, which consists of modifying the geometric field of view (GFOV) while keeping the real field of view (FOV) constant. We define our visual scale factor as the ratio between the GFOV and the FOV. The present study has been carried out on the SAAM dynamic driving simulator and aims at determining the precise effect of this visual scale factor on the speed perception. Twenty subjects have reproduced two speeds (50 and 90 km/h) without knowing the numerical values of these consigns, with five different visual scale factors: 0.70, 0.85, 1.00, 1.15, and 1.30. We show that speed perception significantly increases when the visual factor increases. A 0.15 modification of this factor is enough to obtain a significant effect. Furthermore, the relative variation of the speed perception is proportional to the visual scale factor. Besides, the modification of the geometric field of view remained unnoticed by all the subjects, which implies that this technique can be easily used to make drivers to reduce their speed in driving simulation conditions. However, this technique may also modify perception of distances.},

Driver performance, workload and acceptability were evaluated. As would be expected, speed limiters were the most effective measure; however, in terms of user acceptability this system was least preferred. All the other measures significantly reduced speeds when activated (although not as effectively as the speed limiter), in the order of approximately 6 km/h. It appears that the provision of information or support, in any format, could be effective in reducing speed on curves. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Previous research suggests that participants detect fewer peripheral targets while watching video clips of dynamic hazardous driving scenes due to increases in foveal demand (i.e. the presence of a hazard), increases in peripheral target eccentricity, and the lack of driving experience. The current study aimed to further explore the role of experience as a key factor in the potential narrowing of spatial attention, and the possibility of differences in the time course of attentional deployment. It was predicted that the amount of narrowing due to central processing demands would change as a function of driving experience, with more experienced drivers suffering less narrowing due to their mastery of central processing demands in road scenes. The data did not support the narrowing hypothesis, though they did support the alternative strategic difference between the driver groups in the time-course of attentional deployment. Learners seem to suffer attentional degradation in extra-foveal regions over a longer period of time whereas experienced drivers seem to invest peripheral attention at the hazard location in short but intense bursts.

The relative utility of these sources at different distances is compared, using their ordinal depth-threshold func-tions. From these, three classes of space around a moving observer are postulated: personal space, ac-tion space, and vista space. Within each, a smaller number of sources act in consort, with different rel-ative strengths. Given the general ordinality of the sources, these spaces are likely to be affine in character, stretching and collapsing with viewing conditions. One of these conditions is controlled by lens length in photography and cinematography or by field-of-view commands in computer graphics. These have striking effects on many of these sources of information and, consequently, on how the lay-out of a scene is perceived.},

The second experiment describes a field study in which the proven technique is applied to a stretch of motorway at a site where the accident rate was exceptionally high owing to excessive speed.

  abstract = {Concrete barriers are often installed to separate opposing directions of traffic at hazardous horizontal curves on undivided highways in order to avoid frequent types of crashes such as head-on collisions. Whereas this treatment is effective for preventing head-on crashes, they reduce the available sight distance (ASD). The estimation of sight distance is usually performed under a two-dimensional ( D) approach, despite the three-dimensional ( D) nature of facilities. Radius curve, clearance and trajectory location on cross section are the only variables considered under the planar approach, ignoring the spatial component. To overcome this limitation, this study applies a D sight distance estimation method, where the sight distance reduction caused by installing barriers is evaluated, contemplating their shape and position in a detailed fully D model. The procedure facilitates incorporating mass standardized constructive elements into the highway model. This method consists of a geoprocessing model on a geographic information system (GIS), where the impact of the terrain, the roadway itself, and the road furniture on sight distance is broached. The results evidenced that the ASD outcomes were different under either approach. In addition, the ASD fell below the required stopping sight distance (SSD) of the standards under either approach. A potential application of this method is the analysis of the overall safety effects and the subsequent evaluation of crash modification factors associated to this safety measure.},

By the 2030s, going to a website could mean entering a totally realistic and compelling virtual environment facilitated by miniature computers that interact with brain cells, and people will probably spend most of their time in virtual reality [3]. Although these prospects may sound farfetched, we can already see that virtual-reality-based applications are increasingly used in such common tasks as driving. We use driving simulators for assessment, rehabilitation, learner driver training, race-car driver training, research into safety, and for at-home entertainment and in amusement halls},

The use of visual stereo presentations in driving simulators is used as a case study. A literature review indicates that a stereo presentation is associated with advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are that it can provide a relevant cue for near-distant driving tasks, induce positive reactions amongst par- ticipants, improve validity and credibility of data, improve performance and learning, and create new possibilities for augmented stereo instructions. Disadvantages are that it can increase costs, simulator sickness and distraction, and induce performance reduction in case of display artefacts. Furthermore, various complicating factors related to human perception and individual differences make it difficult to predict the effects of fidelity on training outcome. It is concluded that fidelity requirements are dependent on a compromise; the mentioned advantages and disadvantages of an intervention should be carefully weighted.},

Simulators are being used to an increasing extent for driver training, allowing for the possibility of collecting objective data on driver proficiency under standardised conditions. However, relatively little is known about how learner drivers' simulator measures relate to on-road driving. This study proposes a theoretical framework that quantifies driver proficiency in terms of speed of task execution, violations and errors. This study investigated the relationships between these three measures of learner drivers' (n = 804) proficiency during initial simulation-based training and the result of the driving test on the road, occurring an average of 6 months later. A higher chance of passing the driving test the first time was associated with making fewer steering errors on the simulator and could be predicted in regression analysis with a correlation of 0.18. Additionally, in accordance with the theoretical framework, a shorter duration of on-road training corresponded with faster task execution, fewer violations and fewer steering errors (predictive correlation 0.45). It is recommended that researchers conduct more large-scale studies into the reliability and validity of simulator measures and on-road driving tests. {\copyright} 2009 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Many models have been developed to predict collision frequency and evaluate safety performance on horizontal curves. The approach used in data collection or some assumptions made in the analysis methodology might lead to inaccurate results. For example, manual data collection, equipment limitations, and field experiments involving monitoring driving behavior for a specific region for a short-term are potential sources of errors in data collection. This paper aims at overcoming some of these issues in developing models to evaluate safety performance of horizontal curves and predict the curve collision frequency. The developed models relate expected collision frequency on horizontal curves to the speed reduction from the approach tangent to the curve, which is commonly used as a major geometric design consistency measure. The methodology to achieve this objective included three tasks; data collection, evaluating and modeling the viable speed reduction parameters, and developing safety performance models to estimate collision frequency on horizontal curves. Individual drivers' trips on 49 horizontal curves on rural two-lane highways in rolling and mountainous terrains in Washington State were extracted from the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Models were developed to relate different speed reduction parameters to curve characteristics. These models were then applied to 1430 horizontal curves in Washington State to estimate the speed reduction parameters and relate them to collision frequency. Several safety performance models were developed which show that speed reduction, as a design consistency measure, is directly related to collision frequency on horizontal curves. Furthermore, the speed reduction parameters are more significant variables in predicting collision frequency than all curve geometric parameters.},

  abstract = {The presence of cyclists on Spanish two-lane rural roads is common, so they have to interact with motor vehicles. Due to the speed differential and vulnerability of cyclists, overtaking is one of the most dangerous and frequent interactions. Therefore, a minimum distance of 1.5 m must be observed. The overtaking manoeuvre depends on road section and cyclist group distribution. Interaction between cyclists and vehicles has been characterized in the past but overtaking to cyclist groups has barely been studied. This study uses a driving simulator to analyse how the presence of cyclists and their group configuration affect traffic operation and safety on two-lane rural roads. A fixed driving simulator has been adapted to incorporate cyclists, using speed and lateral position obtained from field studies. Based on field data, a physical scenario and different traffic scenarios have been recreated, so volunteers can drive the simulator -- emulating a motor vehicle -- tracking their speed, lateral position, and other variables. These results can be compared to those observed for checking the validity of this methodology. The driving simulator offers some results which are difficult to obtain through other methodologies, enabling a better analysis of the phenomenon. By sorting different bicycle patterns and including several volunteers, the impact of bicycle pelotons on traffic performance and safety can be characterized. This will help in offering recommendations to integrate cyclists and motor vehicles in a safer way.},

Complying to guidelines is not enough to ensure the highest safety levels, so many of them encourage designers to virtually recreate and test their roads, benefitting from the evolution of driving simulators in recent years. However, an accurate recreation of the road and its environment represents a real bottleneck in the process. A very important limitation lies in the diversity of input data, from different sources and requiring specific adaptations for every single simulator. This paper aims at showing a framework for recreating faster virtual scenarios by using an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based file. This methodology was compared to two other conventional methods for developing driving scenarios. The main outcome of this study has demonstrated that with a data exchange file in IFC format, virtual scenarios can be faster designed to carry out safety audits with driving simulators. As a result, the editing, programming, and processing times were substantially reduced using the proposed IFC exchange file format through a BIM (Building Information Modeling) model. This methodology facilitates cost-savings, execution, and optimization resources in road safety analysis.},

The steering task can be divided into two levels: (1) the guidance level involving the perception of the instantaneous and future course of the forcing function provided by the forward view of the road, and the response to it in an anticipatory open-loop control mode; (2) the stabilization level whereby any occuring deviations from the forcing function are compensated for in a closed-loop control mode. This concept of the duality of the driver's steering activity led to a newly developed two-level model of driver steering behavior. Its parameters were identified on the basis of data measured in driving simulator experiments. The parameter estimates of both levels of the model show significant dependence on the experimental situation which can be characterized by variables such as vehicle speed and desired path curvature. {\copyright} 1978, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Several scenarios under different traffic volumes and lane-ends sign positions are tested to collect the behavioral variables including distance, speed, and acceleration. Three successive stages covering the initiation part (including one stage) and action part (including two stages) are defined to depict driver's acceleration patterns with mathematical formula\- tions. The model reduces the complexity of depicting the lane-changing behavior by using critical accelera\- tion variables. Meanwhile, some important conclusions were found. High traffic volume condition is more prone to aggressive driving behavior which reflected in larger longitudinal and lateral acceleration. Additionally, drivers closer to work zone tend to take an abrupt turning since less merging time and larger lateral acceleration were accepted. These findings are useful in work-zone planning and management.},

The dual necessity of maximizing the understandability of these messages and minimizing the time required to convey these messages to the driver is an obvious one, especially during traffic incident management. The objectives of the research were to analyze the factors that affect the readability and comprehension of multiple phase messages presented on variable message signs during a simulated driving task, and to identify the levels of the factors that maximize driver performance. Specifically, a mid-level driving simulator was used to study the joint effect on driver performance of: obstructions of variable message signs by traffic or road geometry; the sequence in which the individual phases of a two phase message are presented to the driver; the message content; and the number and direction of lane changes required by the driver based on the message presented. The above factors were evaluated for two types of message duration (i.e., the duration for which each phase of a two phase message is presented), one based on existing recommendations and the other based on a proposed duration. Driver performance was evaluated for both durations. Clear advantages were obtained when a message was presented for a relatively short duration and repeated twice during the time in which it was visible. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The interactions between these characteristics in determining accident risk in horizontal curves is only beginning to be understood. This paper summarises the results of studies that have investigated the interaction between the radius of a horizontal curve and the distance to adjacent curves. The shorter the mean distance between curves, the lower is the increase in risk for a given curve radius. The sharper neighbouring curves are, the lower is the increase in risk for a given curve radius.

The present paper reports results from simulated and real motorway driving. Data were collected in a fixed base simulator, a moving base simulator and an instrumented vehicle driven in real traffic. The data collected included speed, lane keeping performance, steering wheel movements, eye movements, physiological signals and self-reported driving performance. The results show that the effects of visual and cognitive load affect driving performance in qualitatively different ways. Visual demand led to reduced speed and increased lane keeping variation. By contrast, cognitive load did not affect speed and resulted in reduced lane keeping variation. Moreover, the cognitive load resulted in increased gaze concentration towards the road centre. Both S-IVIS had an effect on physiological signals and the drivers' assessment of their own driving performance. The study also investigated differences between the three experimental settings (static simulator, moving base simulator and field). The results are discussed with respect to the development of a generic safety test regime for In-vehicle Information Systems. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Driving simulators are increasingly being used as a didactic tool in car racing games because it offers virtual driving experience to users. However, existing driving simulators are found in market at high cost. This paper proposes the design and development of a low cost 2-DOF driving motion simulator with the interface from SimTools. The driving simulator comprises a steering wheel, a pedal and simulator software. When the steering wheel is turned in the racing simulator Live for Speed, it controls the angle of the driver's seat upraising. The input data from the steering wheel is derived using SimTools, which extracts the motion data from the racing simulator. Potentiometer is used as the feedback sensor that manipulates the data from SimTools to control the angle of the dc motor driver rotation. The motion is created using the rotation of two dc motors that actuate the car seat frame. Moto Monster motor driver which supports 30A of current is used to control both of the dc motors using Arduino microcontroller. The angle control of the driver's seat is proportional to the input data from steering wheel. This paper contributes the basic idea on building a low cost motion simulator.},

  abstract = {Database models for road inventories are based on classical schemes for relational databases: many related tables, in which the database designer establishes, a priori, every detail that they consider relevant for inventory management. This kind of database presents several problems. First, adapting the model and its applications when new database features appear is difficult. In addition, the different needs of different sets of road inventory users are difficult to fulfil with these schemes. For example, maintenance management services, road authorities and emergency services have different needs. In addition, this kind of database cannot be adapted to new scenarios, such as other countries and regions (that may classify roads or name certain elements differently). The problem is more complex if the language used in these scenarios is not the same as that used in the database design. In addition, technicians need a long time to learn to use the database efficiently. This paper proposes a flexible, multi-language and multipurpose database model, which gives an effective and simple solution to the aforementioned problems.},

Ergonomics 7, 439-451] argued that drivers attempt to maintain a constant level of anxiety when driving which Wilde [Wilde, G.J.S., 1982. The theory of risk homeostasis: implications for safety and health. Risk Anal. 2, 209-225] interpreted to be coupled to subjective estimates of the probability of collision. This theoretical paper argues that what drivers attempt to maintain is a level of task difficulty. N{\"a}{\"a}t{\"a}nen and Summala [N{\"a}{\"a}t{\"a}nen, R., Summala, H., 1976. Road User Behaviour and Traffic Accidents. North Holland/Elsevier, Amsterdam, New York] similarly rejected the concept of statistical risk as a determinant of driver behaviour, but in so doing fell back on the learning process to generate a largely automatised selection of appropriate safety margins. However it is argued here that driver behaviour cannot be acquired and executed principally in such S-R terms. The concept of task difficulty is elaborated within the framework of the task-capability interface (TCI) model, which describes the dynamic interaction between the determinants of task demand and driver capability. It is this interaction which produces different levels of task difficulty. Implications of the model are discussed regarding variation in performance, resource allocation, hierarchical decision-making and the interdependence of demand and capability. Task difficulty homeostasis is proposed as a key sub-goal in driving and speed choice is argued to be the primary solution to the problem of keeping task difficulty within selected boundaries. The relationship between task difficulty and mental workload and calibration is clarified. Evidence is cited in support of the TCI model, which clearly distinguishes task difficulty from estimates of statistical risk. However, contrary to expectation, ratings of perceived risk depart from ratings of statistical risk but track difficulty ratings almost perfectly. It now appears that feelings of risk may inform driver decision making, as Taylor originally suggested, but not in terms of risk of collision, but rather in terms of task difficulty. Finally risk homeostasis is presented as a special case of task difficulty homeostasis. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In-vehicle systems, from infotainment to head up displays, increasingly make use of telemetry data obtained from the vehicle (e.g., speed, location, brake pedal state). Researchers must carefully study the design and use of these dynamic systems to ensure displays and interactions are optimal for driving. Thus, researchers must have tools to test and refine HUDs and integrated systems, especially in driving simulator environments. However, getting live telemetry data to integrate into new interfaces is often very difficult to accomplish, particularly within a simulator as most simulators do not provide this live-feed. Further, HUD systems can be difficult or expensive to build within a research environment, and limited in their flexibility. We present two new middleware systems, for use in the NADS MiniSim simulator, that accomplish both of these feats: (1) STING, a system for reading live data from the simulator and making it available to researchers; and (2) HUD Designer, a system for creating custom dynamic HUD graphics, and displaying them on any of the MiniSim screens, or on an external HUD. Possible use cases for these systems are discussed, along with where to find more information and download the subsystems.},

  abstract = {This study investigated, by means of a dynamic driving simulator experiment, road users' behavior inside the curves of rural two-lane highways related to different advance warning signs, perceptual measures, and delineation treatments. These treatments were intended to warn drivers of the presence of low radius curves and to affect their behavior, improving vehicle control and lane-keeping. Five surrogate measures of safety were used in the evaluation of the design alternatives in relation to lateral position performance: standard deviation of lateral position, maximum encroachment in the shoulder, maximum encroachment in the opposite lane, relative length of shoulder encroachment, and relative length of opposite lane encroachment. Statistical tests were performed to verify whether the surrogate measures of safety were significantly different between alternatives. The analysis was divided into three phases. In the first phase, all the measures were preprocessed, testing normality and homoscedasticity assumptions. In the second phase, the presence of an overall effect considering all the alternatives was evaluated using analysis of variance and the Kruskal--Wallis test. In the third phase, Student's t- and Mann--Whitney tests were used to assess which alternatives showed statistically significant effects. The results demonstrated that the perceptual measures, namely colored transverse strips, dragon teeth markings, and colored median island, were the most effective treatments. Field tests to establish the perceptual measures' effectiveness on real roads are strongly advised. Implementation of the measures tested in the driving simulator should be carried out on similar rural highways to validate the results.},

  abstract = {The paper investigated drivers' speed behaviour in a section of a rural highway crossing a small urban community in the existing scenario without any traffic calming device and in two different design scenarios with traffic calming in the urban community. Two gateways and four integrative traffic calming devices along the route within the urban area were tested. The gateways were aimed at slowing down the vehicles entering in the built-up area, while the traffic calming devices were aimed at complementing the gateway effect inside the built-up area. Two design options were tested: first option (alt1) is a combination of low cost measures, whereas the second option (alt2) is more expensive as includes a chicane and requires land acquisition. Drivers' behaviour was investigated by means of a driving simulator experiment. The VERA dynamic-driving simulator operating at the TEST Road Safety Laboratory located in Naples (Italy) was used. Simulation results were validated by the comparison of speed behaviour in the real world and in the driving simulator, in the scenario without traffic calming. Analysis of the driving simulator experiment results was performed using two different approaches: (a) explorative description of data by cluster analysis; (b) inferential procedures about population using statistical tests. Cluster analysis was carried out in order to test if the drivers' speed behaviour in the different design alternatives was substantially different. Statistical tests were performed in order to verify if speeds in specific sections were significantly different. Cluster analysis looked at speed profiles, whereas statistical tests looked at speed data in specific points. The obtained results showed a different behaviour of drivers approaching the urban community in the existing scenario and in the design scenarios. In the south direction, mean speed reduction ranging between 16 and 17 km/h, with 5\% level of significance, was observed. In the north direction, mean speed reduction equal to 11 km/h, with 10\% level of significance, was observed. Differences between the two design alternatives were not statistically significant. Along the urban community, a statistically significant mean speed reduction ranging between 9 and 15 km/h was observed in the south direction. In the north direction, speed reduction was not statistically significant. Overall, combined results of cluster analysis and statistical tests showed that the treatments were more effective in the direction with higher speeds in the base scenario.},

Using mature drivers, 24 participants drove an instrumented car and 20 participants drove the simulator in two separate experiments. Participants drove on roads which contained transverse rumble strips at three sites, as well as three equivalent control sites. The three pairs of sites involved deceleration, and were the approaches to stop sign intersections, right curves, and left curves. Numerical correspondence (absolute validity), relative correspondence (or validity), and interactive (or dynamic) relative validity were analyzed, the latter using correlations developed from canonical correlation. Participants reacted to the rumble strips, in relation to their deceleration pattern on the control road, in very similar ways in both the instrumented car and simulator experiments, establishing the relative validities. However, participants generally drove faster in the instrumented car than the simulator, resulting in absolute validity not being established. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Existing roads require periodic evaluation in order to ensure safe transportation. Estimations of the available sight distance (ASD) are fundamental to make sure motorists have sufficient visibility to perform basic driving tasks. Mobile LiDAR Systems (MLS) can provide these evaluations with accurate three-dimensional models of the road and surroundings. Similarly, Geographic Information System (GIS) tools have been employed to obtain ASD. Due to the fact that widespread GIS formats used to store digital surface models handle elevation as an attribute of location, the presented methodology has separated the representation of ground and aboveground elements. The road geometry and surrounding ground are stored in digital terrain models (DTM). Correspondingly, abutting vegetation, manmade structures, road assets and other roadside elements are stored in 3D objects and placed on top of the DTM. Both the DTM and 3D objects are accurately obtained from a denoised and classified LiDAR point cloud. Based on the consideration that roadside utilities and most manmade structures are well-defined geometric elements, some visual obstructions are extracted and/or replaced with 3D objects from online warehouses. Different evaluations carried out with this method highlight the tradeoff between the accuracy of the estimations, performance and geometric complexity as well as the benefits of the individual consideration of road assets.},

  abstract = {Simulation is widely used as a training tool in many domains, and more recently the use of vehicle simulation as a tool for driver and vehicle crew training has become popular (. de Winter et al., 2009; Pradhan et al., 2009). This paper presents an overview of how vehicle simulations are currently used to train driving-related procedural and higher-order cognitive skills, and team-based procedural and non-technical teamwork skills for vehicle crews, and evaluates whether there is evidence these training programs are effective. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of whether training achieves learning objectives and whether the attainment of those objectives enhances real world performance on target tasks. It was concluded that while some higher-order cognitive skills training programs have been shown to be effective, in general the adoption of simulation technology has far outstripped the pace of empirical research in this area. The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues that require consideration when developing and evaluating vehicle simulations for training purposes - based not only on what is known from the vehicle domain, but what can be inferred from other domains in which simulation is an established training approach, such as aviation (e.g. Jentsch et al., 2011) and medicine (e.g. McGaghie et al., 2010). Statement of relevance: Simulation has become a popular tool for driver and vehicle crew training in civilian and military settings. This review considers whether there is evidence that this training method leads to learning and the transfer of skills to real world performance. Evidence from other domains, such as aviation and medicine, is drawn upon to inform the design and evaluation of future vehicle simulation training systems. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

  abstract = {Most existing roads were designed without considering the improved performance of modern vehicles and the new onboard technologies available for assisted driving. In addition, vehicles frequently travel at speeds that exceed the maximum considered in road design. For these reasons, the need for speed- and safety-related countermeasures (e.g., field control, mobile or fixed speed cameras, traffic calming measures) is evident. However, these countermeasures are only partially effective and the proportion of crashes that are speed-related remains significant. This investigation is aimed at the development of a new intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) system based on the available sight distance (ASD). In conditions of poor visibility, the system can (i) inform drivers when they are traveling at inappropriate speeds, or (ii) generate warning sounds to the same effect, or (iii) intervene directly and compel the vehicle to adopt the speed which is most appropriate to the particular ASD. As reported in this methodological paper, the functionality of the new ISA system was tested at the driving simulator of the Politecnico di Torino (Italy) and the resulting estimated ASD value was validated and tested successfully. Future experimental investigations will be devoted to assessing the effectiveness of the system on driver speed behavior and decision making.},

One dataset utilised data from an instrumented vehicle, which recorded driver speed on bends on a rural road. The other utilised data from a driving simulator study. Generally in both datasets the DBQ violation subscale was associated with objectively-measured speed, while the error and lapse sub-scales were not. These findings are consistent with the idea that the DBQ is a valid measure of observed behaviour in real driving (its original intended use) and also in simulated driving. The fact that associations were the same in real and simulated driving lends further support to the relative validity of driving simulation. The need for larger and more focused studies examining the role of different motivations in different driving situations is discussed.},

This improves the ability to discriminate between two similar stimuli but has the side effect that veridical perception is degraded. For example, prolonged driving at 100 km/h may reduce the perceived speed to 80 km/h but improve the sensitivity to changes in the prevailing speed. Here we use radially expanding flow fields with a wide combination of adapt and test speeds to study human speed perception. Adaptation at speeds higher than the test always attenuates perceived speed, whereas adaptation at low and testing at high speeds increases perceived speed. We show that adaptation is stronger (i.e., post-adaptation speeds are perceived as slower) when the dots in the expanding flow field accelerate towards the periphery rather than traveling at constant speeds. We also show that speed discriminability is reduced following adaptation to low speeds when tested at high speeds and increased when the test speed is at or below prior adaptation speeds. We conclude that the relative speeds of the adaptation and test patterns are important parameters governing speed-related adaptation effects in the human brain.},

However, sufficiently accurate or updated information about their geometric characteristics is frequently not available. Therefore, it is common to collect data of road geometry normally by means of a vehicle equipped with various sensors and, from the data obtained, generate analytically a geometric design that fits reality as closely as possible. There are several procedures to recreate the horizontal alignment of existing roads. However, no such effort has been made for vertical alignment. Knowledge of vertical profile's geometry is important for safety traffic studies as sight distance. This paper presents a method of obtaining the geometrical elements of the vertical profile of highways through the longitudinal slope of their centreline points. The procedure has been successfully validated by its application on five rural highways in Spain.},

  abstract = {Inventories are an important tool for management, maintenance and operation of roads. There are different kinds of roads that need inventorying: roadways primarily used for cars, bicycle paths, forest and mountain tracks, hiking trails, tourist routes and others. There are also different agents interested in road inventories: the authorities responsible for the management, the companies interested in designing and building them, the companies responsible for their maintenance, transportation companies, users and emergency teams, etc. There are some standard data models for conducting road inventories, but they are mainly designed for roadways and intended for people in charge of the facility's design, construction and maintenance. There are also situations where personnel not previously trained in road inventorying need to make a quick evaluation, such as after natural disasters. Hence, existing data models do not provide an adequate solution for some kinds of roads, users or situations. This paper describes an open data model that solves the problem of inventorying all kinds of roads for a variety of users and situations. The proposed data model allows assets and geometry to be inventoried and makes it easy to expand and reuse information. The model was applied to rural two-lane roadways, bicycle paths and mountain tracks. The results obtained demonstrate the validity of the proposed data model and how inventories can be conducted by people without previous training. This is a valuable feature after natural disasters or in inventories for small villages, emergency services and others.},

In this paper, we demonstrated the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approach in the esports domain, particularly in simulated racing. To achieve this, we gathered a variety of feature-rich telemetry data from several web sources that was captured through MoTec telemetry software and the ACC simulated racing game. We performed a number of analyses using ML algorithms to classify the laps into the performance levels, evaluating driving behaviors along these performance levels, and finally defined a prediction model highlighting the channels/features that have significant impact on the driver performance. To identify the optimal feature set, three feature selection algorithms, i.e., the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) have been applied where out of 84 features, a subset of 10 features has been selected as the best feature subset. For the classification, XGBoost outperformed RF and SVM with the highest accuracy score among the other evaluated models. The study highlights the promising use of AI to categorize sim racers according to their technical-tactical behaviour, enhancing sim racing knowledge and know how.},

There were two in-vehicle distracter tasks: operating the vehicle entertainment system and conducting a simulated hands-free mobile phone conversation. The effect of visual clutter was examined by requiring participants to drive in simple and complex road environments. Overall measures of driving performance were collected, together with responses to roadway hazards and subjective measures of driver perceived workload. The two in-vehicle distraction tasks degraded overall driving performance, degraded responses to hazards and increased subjective workload. The performance decrements that occurred as a result of in-vehicle distraction were observed in both the simple and complex highway environments and for drivers in different age groups. One key difference was that older drivers traveled at lower mean speeds in the complex highway environment compared with younger drivers. The conclusions of the research are that both in-vehicle tasks impaired several aspects of driving performance, with the entertainment system distracter having the greatest negative impact on performance, and that these findings were relatively stable across different driver age groups and different environmental complexities. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that participants were better able to maintain lane position and speed with the enhanced markings than with the standard markings. A similar pattern was found for the subjective measures: workload was rated as lower for the enhanced markings; likewise, subjects reported the drives as being easier and were more confident in being able to drive safely when the roads displayed the enhanced markings.

Nowadays, with 90\% of secure transactions occurring on smart phones and other hand-held devices, a low onchip area and a high speed algorithm to perform the same becomes the need for the day. In order to meet this requirement, several algorithms have been designed and implemented in the past, but each of these algorithms possess their own shortcomings with respect to an ASIC or an FPGA implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel and area efficient architecture for performing the mix columns \& inverse mix columns operation, which is the major operation in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) method of cryptography. We perform the same using ancient Vedic Mathematics techniques. The cryptographic unit involving mix columns \& inverse mix columns for AES was designed and implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 3e series of FPGA. A 100\% area efficiency and a 2 times increase in speed was achieved by the novel algorithm, in comparison with two other popular implementations of the same.},

  abstract = {Transition zones are a road section where posted speed drops from higher to lower limits. Due to the sudden changes in posted speed limits and road environment, drivers usually do not adapt to the posted speed limits and underestimate their traveling speed. Previous studies have highlighted that crash rates are usually higher in these sections. This study aims at improving the safety at transition zones by introducing perceptual measures that are tested using a driving simulator. The proposed measures are speed limit pavement markings with a gradual increase of brightness and/or size that were placed at transition zones in simulation scenarios replicating the real-world environment of the Doha Expressway in Qatar. These innovative measures aim to produce the impression of increased speed that could stimulate drivers to better adapt speed limits. The driving behavior of 81 drivers possessing a valid Qatari driving license was recorded with a driving simulator interfaced with STISIM Drive{\textregistered} 3. Results showed that pavement markings combining size and brightness manipulations were the most effective treatment, keeping drivers' traveling speed significantly below the traveling speed recorded in the untreated control condition. In this regard, the maximum mean speed reductions of 5.3 km/h and 4.6 km/h were observed for this treatment at the first transition (120 to 100 km/h) and second transition (100 to 80 km/h) zones, respectively. Regarding the variations in drivers' lateral position, the results showed that the proposed pavement markings did not negatively influence drivers' lateral control on the road as the maximum observed standard deviation of lateral position was around 0.065 m. This study shows that the proposed pavement markings are recommended for improving the speed adaptation of drivers in the transition zones.},

Objective: The objective of this study is to validate a fixed-base driving simulator for speed perception and actual speed and to support its application in traffic safety studies. Method: The study consisted of two experiments to test the external and subjective validity of the driving simulator in absolute and relative terms. External validity was framed into two parts i.e. for speed perception and actual speed. In the first part, the external validity was assessed based on the speed perception observations from forty volunteers that participated in the study. Speed estimations for four different requested speeds (50, 70, 80 and 100 kph) were recorded under two conditions: speedometer hidden and speedometer revealed. In the second part, the external validity was assessed based on the comparison of actual speed observations from field and simulator. The subjective validity of the simulator setting was assessed through a questionnaire. Results: Results from both experiments showed correspondence of the driving behavior between the simulator and real-world settings. In general, the profiles for estimated speed and actual speed followed a significantly similar tendency and indicated relative validity in both experiments. Moreover, external absolute validity for speed perception was established on all the requested speeds with speedometer hidden while only for the requested speed of 80 kph with speedometer revealed. Participants' evaluation of the quality and performance of the driving simulator supported the subjective validity of the simulator setting. Conclusion: The fixed-base driving simulator used in this study can be considered as a useful tool for research on actual speed and speed perception.},

Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized to efficiently complete data acquisition very soon after identifying an issue when searching for potential highway safety risks. A double grid flight is proposed to obtain an adequate three-dimensional (3D) recreation of the road environment, ensuring an unbiased sight distance output. Then, a dense cloud point is derived through a Structure from Motion Multi-View Stereo process. The point cloud is classified to produce both a terrain model, characterized by its resolution, and a 3D-object model, characterized by the maximum edge length of the entities. The resulting road environment model is utilized to calculate sight distance in a geographic information system. The results enabled the detection of accident-prone locations caused by sight distance limitations. Moreover, the impact of the 3D modeling parameters on the results was assessed.},

  abstract = {Road authorities considering the implementation of speed management interventions should have access to the results of scientifically robust evaluations on which to base their decisions. However, studies that evaluate a diverse range of interventions with comparable metrics are rare, with most focussing on one type, for example, types of signage, perceptual countermeasures or physical traffic calming. This paper describes a driving simulator study designed to overcome these constraints. Twenty diverse speed-reducing treatments were developed and tested in urban and rural road environments. Forty participants encountered all the treatments allowing a comparison to be made with their driving behaviour when the treatment was not present. A number of speed parameters were developed to encapsulate the range of effects of the treatments. The results suggest that whilst straight sections of road are difficult to treat, speed reductions can be obtained by increasing risk perception. In contrast, alerting treatments had more effect at junctions, particularly in an urban environment; drivers approaching curves demonstrated improved speed adaptation if the curve radius was highlighted (either implicitly or explicitly). The study highlights how driving simulators can be used to overcome methodological constraints encountered in real-world evaluations of this type. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed framework generates a traffic stream, corresponding to a given target flow and simulates realistic interactions between vehicles. The framework is based on an approach in which only a limited area around the driving simulator vehicle is simulated. This closest neighborhood is divided into one inner area and two outer areas. Vehicles in the inner area are simulated according to a microscopic simulation model including advanced submodels for driving behavior while vehicles in the outer areas are updated according to a less time-consuming mesoscopic simulation model. The presented work includes a new framework for generating and simulating vehicles within a moving area. It also includes the development of an enhanced model for overtakings and a simple mesoscopic traffic model. The framework has been validated on the number of vehicles that catch up with the driving simulator vehicle and vice versa. The agreement is good for active and passive catch-ups on rural roads and for passive catch-ups on freeways, but less good for active catch-ups on freeways. The reason for this seems to be deficiencies in the utilized lane-changing model. It has been verified that the framework is able to achieve the target flow and that there is a gain in computational time of using the outer areas. The framework has also been tested within the VTI Driving simulator III. {\copyright} 2008 ACM.},

We evaluate our approach in several prototypic traffic situations in which we compare the resulting artificial agents against human drivers as well as against simple baseline implementations of artificial drivers. As a result, we show that particular ranges of parameters of a driver profile can be inferred for which the simulated driving behavior does not change. We further show that precision depends on the amount of data and the scenarios in which these were recorded. The proposed method can also be applied to compare human and artificial driving behavior.},

Two driving simulator experiments were performed. The results were compared to those of a field study (Van der Horst, 1990). When approaching a stationary vehicle, subjects were instructed to brake as late as possible, without causing a collision. The instruction was either to brake "hard", or to brake "normal". Experiment 1 showed that the timing of the start of the braking maneuver was not affected by field of view and scene complexity. Yet, the coordination of the ongoing braking maneuver was more realistic with increasing field of view (120 versus 40'). In contrast to the Van der Horst (1990) study, in the present experiment drivers took larger safety margins (i.e., started to brake earlier) with higher approach speeds. This result indicates that, for the present task, perceptual information at larger distances was insufficient in the driving simulator, even with 120' FOV and a relatively complex scene. In Experiment 2 on half of the trials the image was occluded immediately after the onset of the braking maneuver, in order to investigate the use of visual information after the start of the braking maneuver. Results showed that without visual information during the braking maneuver, drivers tended to overshoot the intended stopping position more often. This result indicates that drivers use visual information during the braking maneuver in order to timely stop before the stationary vehicle.},

In all these applications, one of the important arithmetic operations frequently performed is to multiply and accumulate with a small computational time (delay). As in all the arithmetic operations, it is the squaring which is most important in finding the transforms or the inverse transforms in signal processing. The squaring operation occupies most of the computing time; therefore, it becomes imperative to concentrate on improving the speed with which we square the numbers. The squaring operation also forms the backbone in cryptography. In this paper, we propose a technique for implementing squaring operation using Vedic methods in VHDL and evaluate the performance. The results are compared with the conventional Booth's algorithm in terms of time delay and area occupied on the Xilinx Virtex 4vlx15sf363-12.},

However, validation studies need to be conducted before extrapolating driving simulator results from the laboratory to a real-world driving environment.

A mountainous two-lane rural road in Iran was simulated and the driving speeds of 30 participants were collected at the beginning, middle and end of five curves in the simulator. The driving speeds of 40 different participants were also measured at specified points of five curves in the real road using a radar gun. The curves studied included a horizontal curve on a positive grade, three combined crest curves and one combined sag curve. The results of bilateral z-tests indicated that both experiments belonged to the same population and independent t-tests indicated equality of variances for all curves. In most curves, except the combined crest curve with a radius of 300\,m, the mean speeds in the driving simulator were higher than the real-road condition. The trends in speed variation from the beginning to the end of the curve were similar in both experiments.},

A combination of chevron signs with three promising treatments included herringbones, sealed shoulder and a yellow blinking signal was applied to hazardous curve sections in a driving simulator. Performance measures consisted of mean of speed and lateral position. The results indicated that combining chevrons and a warning blinking signal is the most appropriate treatment for horizontal and crest vertical curves, as this resulted in lower speed and lateral position. In addition, speed and lateral position variations along the curves were lower compared to other treatments specially, with an on-coming vehicle. Sealed shoulder makes drivers drive faster while entering a curve and brake suddenly while changing direction. Using herring bones is found to reduce speed and speed differential along the curve but not lateral position which was even higher in treated curves particularly, in presence of an on-coming vehicle.},

This is largely because simulation saves engineering time and costs, and can be used for studies of road and traffic safety. How applicable driving simulation is to the real world is unclear however, because analyses of perceptual criteria carried out in driving simulation experiments are controversial. On the one hand, recent data suggest that, in driving simulators with a large field of view, longitudinal speed can be estimated correctly from visual information. On the other hand, recent psychophysical studies have revealed an unexpectedly important contribution of vestibular cues in distance perception and steering, prompting a re-evaluation of the role of visuo-vestibular interaction in driving simulation studies.},

A driving simulation course has been developed which covered a representative selection of driving tasks of moderate difficulty as well as scenarios which are particularly difficult for elderly drivers. Driving errors were semi-automatically registered and classified by a tablet PC application. Based on the registered driving errors, the driving competence of each driver was rated on an 11-point fitness-to-drive (FtD) rating scale by specifically trained raters. The driving course was validated on the basis of a 60-minute standardized driving test in real traffic. By including similar driving tasks, it was ensured that it was structurally comparable to the simulated course. 30 elderly drivers ({$>$} 70 years) and 30 control drivers (25-50 years) were assessed in the simulation and in real traffic. During the driving tests, more driving errors were registered for the elderly drivers than for the controls both in the simulator and in real traffic. FtD-ratings and total number of driving errors during the driving tests in the simulation correlated up to r = .80 with the FtD-ratings of the driving tests in real traffic. ROC-Analyses revealed at Sensitivity-Specificity Ratio of 85.71 : 82.61 at best. Overall, driving simulation was well accepted by the subjects.},

Thirty volunteers from the driving population were asked to drive an instrumented car along a section of road on the UCF campus. A distance measurement instrument provided a log of instantaneous speed, cumulative distance, and elapsed time at designated points along the route for subsequent analysis. The second phase of the research entailed driving in the UCF driving simulator, which consists of a complete vehicle cab with a wraparound screen for displaying computer-generated images of a synthetic road and surroundings. Computer-generated imagery of the identical campus road and environment was viewable to the subjects in the simulator. Drivers were asked to perform the same task in the simulator as they did in the real driving environment. Identical information was acquired during field testing and the simulation runs. Speed data from the field and simulator were analyzed using conventional statistical tests to determine whether drivers responded differently in the simulator compared with their response during the real driving experience. Preliminary results of the statistical analysis indicated that the drivers behaved similarly at 10 of 16 designated locations along the road. Confidence intervals for the difference between the simulator and the field mean speeds indicated a tendency of drivers to travel at slower speeds in the simulator. These results, along with qualitative feedback from the subjects concerning the handling characteristics of the simulator, are being studied to determine the necessary simulator refinements and upgrades required before additional validation testing.},

  abstract = {Road crashes are the main cause of death of young people in the developed world. The reasons that cause traffic crashes are numerous; however, most researchers agree that a lack of driving experience is one of the major contributing factors. In addition it has been demonstrated that environmental factors such as driving during night and rain increases the risk of a crash. Both of these factors may be related to drivers' visual search strategies that become more efficient with increased experience. In the present study we recorded the eye movements of driving instructors and learner drivers while they drove three virtual routes that included day, night and rain routes in a driving simulator. The results showed that driving instructors had an increased sampling rate, shorter processing time and broader scanning of the road than learner drivers. This broader scanning of the road could be possibly explained by the mirror inspection pattern which revealed that driving instructors fixated more on the side mirrors than learner drivers. Also it was found that poor visibility conditions, especially rain, decrease the effectiveness of drivers' visual search. The lack of interaction between driving experience and visibility suggests that some aspects of visual search are affected by general rather than situation specific driving experience. The present findings support the effect of driving experience in modifying eye movement strategies. The high accident risk of night and rain driving could be partly explained by the decrement in visual search strategies during these conditions. Finally it is argued that the use of driving simulators can provide valuable insights regarding driving safety. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {How can we improve learner drivers' visual skills? Much research has demonstrated that learner drivers have an impoverished spread of search during driving and that this is partly due to lack of knowledge of where and when to look, rather than simply an issue of cognitive load. Several training interventions have tried to improve scanning in these drivers with limited success. We propose that exposing drivers to examples of good and bad scanning behaviour may prove to be a useful tool in training visual search. The success of this approach, however, requires drivers to be able to distinguish between examples of good and bad scanning. To this end, two studies were undertaken where video clips of simulated driving with an overlaid eye movement trace were presented to participants who had to judge whether the eye movements were that of a learner driver or a driving instructor. Overall, participants found this discrimination task very difficult. However, the findings suggested that novice and learner drivers were able to correctly classify those eye movement traces of other learner drivers better than chance. It was also demonstrated that the ability to distinguish between the eye movements of learner drivers and driving instructors improved as the number of objective differences between the two groups increased across specific scenarios (as determined by frame-by-frame analysis using a priori categories). The results suggest that, under certain situations, drivers can extract information about the appropriateness of a particular scanning strategy just by watching a video of the eye movement trace. The implications for training interventions are discussed. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

There are many theories about what features a driver might use(1-3), and recent attempts to engineer self-steering vehicles have sharpened interest in the mechanisms involved(4,5). However, there is little direct information linking steering performance to the driver's direction of gaze(3). We have made simultaneous recordings of steering-wheel angle and drivers' gaze direction during a series of drives along a tortuous road. We found that drivers rely particularly on the 'tangent point' an the inside of each curve, seeking this point 1-2 s before each bend and returning to it throughout the bend. The direction of this point relative to the car's heading predicts the curvature of the road ahead, and we examine the way this information is used.},

Both are achieved by turning the steering wheel, but it is not dear which part or parts of the road ahead supply the visual information needed, or how it is used. Current models of the behaviour of real drivers(1,2) or 'co-driver' simulators(3-5) vary greatly in their implementation of these tasks, but all agree that successful steering requires the driver to monitor the angular deviation of the road from the vehicle's present heading at some 'preview' distance ahead, typically about Is into the future. Eye movement recordings generally support this view(6-9). Here we have used a simple road simulator, in which only certain parts of the road are displayed, to show that at moderate to high speeds accurate driving requires that both a distant and a near region of the road are visible. The former is used to estimate road curvature and the latter to provide position-in-lane feedback. At lower speeds only the near region is necessary, These results support a two-stage model(1) of driver behaviour.},

Using principal component analysis, two performance indices were developed from the criteria to represent the overall performance in simulated driving and the on-road assessment. There was significant positive association between the two indices, with the simulated driving performance index explaining over two-thirds of the variability of the on-road driving performance index, after adjustment for age and gender of the drivers.

Such telemetry data can provide useful information for haptic rendering, and this advantage has been exploited by the industry. This approach applies to any applications that export telemetry data in run time. The haptic rendering module operates as a separate process that accesses the telemetry data in parallel with the application. It is simple, efficient, and modular while retaining the application intact. We examine the approach's viability for user experience improvement by developing three telemetry-based haptic rendering algorithms for car racing games. They express the car engine response, collisions with external objects, and the road surface texture, respectively. Building a haptics-enabled driving platform, we conducted a user study comparing gaming experiences between our telemetry-based algorithms and conventional sound-to-tactile conversion algorithms. The results showed that the telemetry-based effects elicited better experiences than the sound-based effects.},

The authors aim to explore the validity of driving simulator technology use in assessment of drivers with PD and highlight the possibility of such technology's clinical use in assessment improvement and this population's on-road safety. A driving instructor and driver trained occupational therapist assessed 53 idiopathic PD and 129 age-matched controls in the STISIM driving simulator and on open roads. A geriatrician medically screened PD participants prior to the driving assessments. There was aggregation of specific driving task scores to a composite score representing overall participant driving performance. To explore, independent driving task variable effects, multivariate analysis was employed. There was a negative confirmed association with age and participant driving performance (r between 0.79 to 0.89, p {$<$} 0.001). As reflected by lower on-road scores and lower simulated driving performance score, there was significantly less competency among drivers with PD than with controls. Reduced rear view and side mirror usage, inappropariate exit roundabout signaling, and failure to appropriately check the blind spot were the most committed roadway errors. Simulated driving performance in the PD group can explain 39.1\% of the on-road performance variability, after adjustment for age and gender, whereas 68\% was explained by the control group. Study conclusions indicated there was significantly less competence among PD drivers than among the age matched control group. In the driving simulator, a normal older adult population reflected more true driving performance in the PD group. It is not surprising to see the lower reflection in a disease group. There is potential to use simulator technology in unsafe PD driver screening.}

Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood. {\copyright} 1986 Biometrika Trust.},

A second purpose was to examine different task demands and stimulus characteristics supporting rhythm-based versus energy-based processing. A third purpose was to examine speed changes indicative of changes in motion sensitivity. Participants were tested in a car simulator, with FoV resembling low front-door windows, and with VRMs inside the car. Three main results were found. Larger FoV, both horizontally and peripherally--vertically, significantly reduced participants' speed, as did VRMs. Delineator posts and road center lines were used for participants' rhythm-based processing, when the task was to drive at target speeds. Rich motion-flow cues presented initially resulted in lower egospeed in subsequent conditions with relatively less motion-flow cues. The practical implication is that non-iconic, naturalistic and intuitive interfaces can effectively instill spontaneous speed adaptation in drivers.},

A procedure was devised to accurately recreate highway guardrails in three dimensions (3D), fitting the barriers onto the curve roadsides. The effect of these devices on the reduction of the ASD was thus evaluated in a set of case studies comprising different curve radii overlapped with different vertical alignments and combined each with two safety barriers in two-lane rural roads. The 3D models of highway curves with the selected guardrails were created in a geographic information system. Then, a geoprocessing model was used to compute the ASD. The results made it possible to quantify the ASD reduction produced by the barrier with a higher containment level in relation to the highway design parameters, which can assist authorities in developing more comprehensive safety device standards.

Um die Frage der Repr{\"a}sentativit{\"a}t von GPS -- Datens{\"a}tzen f{\"u}r den deutschen Raum zu untersuchen, wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit das Radverkehrsverhalten von Radfahrer*innen im Raum Dresden analysiert. Grundlage der Analyse ist ein im Rahmen des Forschungsprojektes ,,RadVerS`` erhobener GPS-Datensatz von 200 Proband*innen, der 5.300 Einzelwege im Untersuchungsgebiet der Stadt Dresden enth{\"a}lt und Einblicke in deren Radverkehrsverhalten erlaubt. Die erhobenen Daten wurden mit unterschiedlichen Verfahren aufbereitet, so wurden beispielsweise Fahrten mit anderen Verkehrsmodi entfernt und Fahrten in einzelne Wege aufgeteilt. Anschlie{\ss}end wurden die Wegedaten mit Daten aus dem Verkehrsnetz des Untersuchungsgebietes angereichert und statistisch ausgewertet. Der Einfluss einzelner Fahrverhaltensparameter wurde dabei sowohl deskriptiv als auch mittels eines generalisierten linearen Modells ausgewertet. Das Ergebnis der Untersuchungen zeigt, dass folgende Attribute Einfluss auf das Rad-verkehrsverhalten aufweisen und somit ma{\ss}geblich die Diskussion {\"u}ber die Repr{\"a}sentativit{\"a}t von GPS Daten f{\"u}r die Radverkehrsplanung bestimmen sollten. Dabei offenbaren sich Unterscheide zum Vorgehen bei Haushaltsbefragungen: - Alter: Es ist sicherzustellen, dass in der Stichprobe insbesondere sehr junge ({$<$} 30 Jahre) und {\"a}ltere ({$>$}65 Jahre) Nutzer*innen entsprechend enthalten sind. Die Altersklassen zwischen 30 und 65 k{\"o}nnen dagegen zusammengefasst werden und sind i. d. R. ausreichend repr{\"a}sentiert. - Geschlecht: Diejenigen weiblichen Teilnehmerinnen, welche in Smartphone-basierten Stichproben enthalten sind, bewegen sich auf dem Fahrrad mit langsameren Geschwindigkeiten als m{\"a}nnliche Probanden. Zudem beschleunigen sie weniger stark und ihre zur{\"u}ckgelegten Entfernungen sind k{\"u}rzer als die der m{\"a}nnlichen Probanden. - Wegezweck: Die in smartphone-basierten Stichproben enthaltenen Arbeitswege sind tendenziell l{\"a}nger als Einkaufs- und Freizeitwege - Die auf Arbeitswegen gefahrenen Geschwindigkeiten sind zudem h{\"o}her als bei den {\"u}brigen Wegezwecken Oben aufgef{\"u}hrte Parameter haben nur einen geringen und nicht signifikanten Einfluss auf die Infrastrukturnutzung durch Radfahrer*innen. So konnten nur geringe Unterschiede bei der Wahl der Infrastruktur zwischen Geschlechtern, unterschiedlichen Altersklassen und Radfahrtypen festgestellt werden. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus l{\"a}sst sich feststellen, dass nach erfolgter Datenaufbereitung die Wege-weitenverteilung und der Tagesgang der Radfahrten im Wesentlichen kongruent zu den Ergebnissen von Haushaltsbefragungen wie beispielsweise Mobilit{\"a}t in St{\"a}dten (SrV) sind.},

The validation was based on continuous speed profiles collected from 28 volunteers on a 30-km-long, two-lane rural road section. The same volunteers drove through the same road section built in SE               2               RCO. Speed data of 79 curves and 52 tangents were selected for the analysis. Comparison of the real and simulated speeds ensured the simulator's objective validity according to average and operating speeds. Two models were developed to predict field speeds from simulated speeds. Results showed that a simulated average speed lower than approximately 90 km/h was linked to a similar real average speed. For higher simulated speeds, the average speed in the real environment was lower than the simulated one. In addition, the actual operating speed was around 5 km/h lower than the operating speed in the driving simulator. Most volunteers assessed the quality and similarity of the virtual environment compared with the real world as medium or high and assessed the driving tasks similarly, thus achieving subjective validation of the simulator.},

It is suitable for a more realistic simulation of human longitudinal guidance behaviour in the lower velocity range, like in urban traffic. The algorithm was identified and developed by means of a driving simulator study, which is introduced as well. While the decision making process in recent car following models based on Wiedemann is solely determined by the time headway to the leading vehicle, the results of the study show that information about time to collision is also used in the lower velocity range. This approach delivers a more realistic simulation of human car following behaviour, which can be integrated into driver models for microscopic traffic simulations and for the control of surrounding traffic in driving simulators.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first results of the innovative education project carried out in Moncloa Campus (Madrid) in 2018 and supported by the Technical University of Madrid (UPM). A multidisciplinar working group with students from different backgrounds was trained in Moncloa Campus to support humanitarian aid organizations in quasi-real-time mapping of the impacts of disasters and catastrophes (earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic events, floods, ...). Additionally, the group was also trained into the Missing Maps initiative, devoted to map areas that are in perpetual need or humanitarian risk in collaboration with organizations such as the Red Cross and M{\'e}decins Sans Fronti{\`e}res. This initiative is carried out hand in hand with Geoinquietos, a group of professionals committed to the generation of open cartographic data in the frame of OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian OSM (HOTOSM). The project has a double purpose: formative and humanitarian. The training aspect is materialized in the acquisition of relevant specific and transversal competences on Geomatics and Cartography, as well as in Team Working. The humanitarian purpose is based on the possibility of joining a significant number of volunteers to support organizations and governments in the most important moments after disasters. A first group was formed in Moncloa Campus, with around 20 volunteers that were trained during three sessions in humanitarian mapping. Then, the group worked together in six mapping sessions on HOTOSM. Additionally, the group participated in the workshop "Towards an evidence-based decision-making for Cities in Africa" on 24-25 May. After this workshop, the group began collaborating with the Working Group for the Makeni Human Observatory (CEU-UPM-UN-Habitat). This collaboration is going on in course 2018-19. A new group will be promoted in the South Campus, also in Madrid. First results show that students acquired relevant training in Geographic Information Systems and Humanitarian Aid, achieving specific (ICT and Geomatics) and cross-cutting skills (teamwork, international cooperation, humanitarian aid).},

  abstract = {This paper is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of driving behavior on horizontal curves of two-lane rural highways in terms of trajectories in relation to the different curve radii and directions by a driving simulator experiment. The driving simulator experiment involved 50 drivers and eight classes of curve radii, ranging from 125 m to 800 m. Overall, 2000 curve trajectories were analyzed and classified. Six major classes were defined: (1) ideal behavior, (2) normal behavior, (3) driving close to the centerline, (4) driving outside in curve approach, (5) cutting, and (6) correcting. Furthermore, 21 sub-classes were introduced to consider both lane departures and location of the corrective actions. The CATANOVA tests and Bhapkar's tests showed that both the curve radius and the curve direction had a significant effect on the classification results. To get a clearer understanding of the effect of the curve radius and direction on curve negotiation, three macro-classes corresponding to safe, intermediate, and dangerous behavior were introduced. The safest behaviors significantly increased with the curve radius while the most dangerous behaviors significantly decreased with the curve radius. Furthermore, left curves showed a higher proportion of dangerous trajectories. Overall, it seems that the driving trajectories are a promising surrogate measure of safety as highlighted by the correlation between the trajectories identified as dangerous and the radii of the curves.},

The control group received a full simulation condition while each of the remaining five groups performed with certain combinations of motion and sound deleted. Each driver generated nine minutes of continuous data from which five performance measures were derived. Results indicate that the performance measures of yaw, lateral, and velocity deviation are significantly affected by the deletion of cues. In support of the hypothesis that driver performance is augmented by the addition of motion cues, statistically significant negative correlations were obtained between the number of motion cues present and the measures of yaw and lateral deviation. With respect to motion and audio cues, recommendations are made regarding simulator design criteria.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that lane-width reduction makes drivers operate vehicles closer to the center of the road whereas hard-shoulder widening induces a position farther away from the road's center. The goal of the present driving-simulator study was twofold. First, it was aimed at further investigating the respective effects of lane and shoulder width on in-lane positioning strategies, by examining vehicle distance from the center of the lane. The second aim was to assess the impact on safety of three possible cross-sectional reallocations of the width of the road (i.e., three lane-width reductions with concomitant shoulder widening at a fixed cross-sectional width) as compared to a control road. The results confirmed that lane-width reduction made participants drive closer to the road's center. However, in-lane position was affected differently by lane narrowing, depending on the traffic situation. In the absence of oncoming traffic, lane narrowing gave rise to significant shifts in the car's distance from the lane's center toward the edge line, whereas this distance remained similar across lane widths during traffic periods. When the shoulders were at least 0.50 m wide, participants drove farther away from both the road center and the lane center. Road reallocation operations resulted in vehicles positioned farther away from the edge of the road and less swerving behavior, without generating higher driving speeds. Finally, it is argued that road-space reallocation may serve as a good low-cost tool for providing a recovery area for steering errors, without impairing drivers' behavior.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate steering control in a low-cost driving simulator with and without a virtual vehicle cab. Background: In low-cost simulators, the lack of a vehicle cab denies driver access to vehicle width, which could affect steering control, insofar as locomotor adjustments are known to be based on action-scaled visual judgments of the environment. Method: Two experiments were conducted in which steering control with and without a virtual vehicle cab was investigated in a within-subject design, using cornering and straight-lane-keeping tasks. Results: Driving around curves without vehicle cab information made drivers deviate more from the lane center toward the inner edge in right (virtual cab = 4 {\textpm} 19 cm; no cab = 42 {\textpm} 28 cm; at the apex of the curve, p {$<$}.001) but not in left curves. More lateral deviation from the lane center toward the edge line was also found in driving without the virtual cab on straight roads (virtual cab = 21 {\textpm} 28 cm; no cab = 36 {\textpm} 27 cm; p {$<$}.001), whereas driving stability and presence ratings were not affected. In both experiments, the greater lateral deviation in the no-cab condition led to significantly more time driving off the lane. Conclusion: The findings strongly suggest that without cab information, participants underestimate the distance to the right edge of the car (in contrast to the left edge) and thus vehicle width. This produces considerable differences in the steering trajectory. Application: Providing a virtual vehicle cab must be encouraged for more effectively capturing drivers' steering control in low-cost simulators.},

The three measures were compared using a nonparametric index that captures the criteria of constancy during self-paced driving and sensitivity during forced-paced driving. In a driving simulator, 24 participants completed two forced-paced and one self-paced run. Each run held four different lane width conditions. Results showed that participants drove faster on wider lanes, thus confirming the expected speed adaptation. None of the three measures offered persuasive evidence for speed adaptation because they failed either the sensitivity criterion (GSR) or the constancy criterion (TLC, SRTE). An additional measure, steering reversal rate, outperformed the other three measures regarding sensitivity and constancy, prompting a further evaluation of the role of control activity in speed adaptation.},

Indeed, the absence of this information causes drivers to underestimate their speed and consequently increases the risk of road departure. This study tries to visually compensate for this loss of vestibular information through a tilt movement of the frame of reference of the driver. This tilt is the same as that perceived in a bend because of the load transfer of the car. The results indicate that most participants are influenced by this visual information and modify their speed accordingly whilst taking a bend. Nevertheless, only those participants uninformed about the presence of this assistance did slow down, whereas informed participants accelerated. This effect has been interpreted as a consequence of the level of processing implicated in the steering task (implicit versus explicit processing).},

The focus is to provide drivers with real-time insights and feedback on their performance during a simulator training session. By using a combination of the principles of process mining and statistical analysis, data markers are created on the track. Based on the differences in telemetry, visual feedback is provided to the driver. Throughout the research, this manner of training has proven to be promising. Drivers showed an increase in their overall performance and an increase in car control and confidence. Despite these promising results more experiments need to be done to guarantee a consistent outcome and to prove the effectiveness of this training program. To continue developments, further research can be conducted on the topic of visualization and communication.},

The study results showed that the advance warning signs, perceptual measures, and delineation treatments tested in the driving simulator experiment produced significant effects on driver behavior. The perceptual treatments (i.e., colored transverse strips, dragon teeth markings, colored median island) were the most effective treatments because they produced significant speed reductions in the approach tangent as well as inside the curve. Deceleration behavior in the approach to the curve was affected significantly by the presence of treatments that helped drivers to detect the curve earlier; early detection provided more time to perform deceleration maneuvers at lower rates. The study results strongly supported the real-world implementation of colored transverse strips, dragon teeth markings, and the colored median island. Implementation of the tested measures should be conducted on similar rural highways to validate general application of the results of this study to other regions.},

  abstract = {This paper investigated, by means of a dynamic driving-simulator experiment, drivers' behavior at curves on rural two-lane highways in relation to different advance warning signs, perceptual measures, and delineation treatments. The tested treatments were intended to alert drivers to the presence of curves, prompting a reduction in curve approach speeds, and to affect drivers' speed as they drove through curves. A benefit--cost analysis was performed to determine the economic feasibility of applying the countermeasures to speeding tested in the driving simulator. Study results showed that all the treatments produced significant effects on drivers' speed behavior at curves on rural two-lane highways. The perceptual treatments (i.e., colored transverse strips, dragon-teeth markings, and colored median island) were the most effective. The safety benefits measured in lower crash costs arising from speed reductions were much greater than the costs of the alternatives. The most cost-effective treatment was the curve warning sign because of the lower cost. However, colored transverse strips and dragon-teeth markings produced higher benefits and were highly cost-effective for average daily traffic greater than 1,000 vehicles per day. The study results strongly support real-world implementation of colored transverse strips, dragon-teeth markings, and the colored median island.},

  abstract = {Aim of the study was to investigate, by means of a driving simulator experiment, drivers' behaviour in terms of speed, deceleration, and lateral position on major approaches of rural intersections in relation to different perceptual cues. In the experiment, ten different design conditions with and without speed-reducing treatments along the approach to the intersection were tested. Twenty-three drivers drove a test route two times and data from the second drive were used for comparison. The order of the ten design conditions was counterbalanced for all the drivers to minimize the presentation order effect. Three different data analysis techniques were used: (a) cluster analysis of speed and lateral position data, (b) statistical tests of speed and lateral position data, and (c) categorical analysis of deceleration behaviour patterns. The most effective treatments were the dragon teeth markings (based on the principle of optical road narrowing), the colored intersection area (based on the principle of intersection highlighting), and the raised median island (based on the principle of physical road narrowing). These measures, in comparison to the base intersection, produced: (1) a significant speed reduction starting from 250 m before the intersection in the range between 13 and 23 km/h, (2) a significant change in the deceleration behaviour with a reduction in the proportion of drivers which did not decelerate, and (3) a shift away from the intersection of the deceleration beginning. Given the significant effects on drivers' behaviour, the dragon teeth markings, the colored intersection area, and the raised median island are strongly recommended for real world implementation. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Furthermore, the level of detail in the model, a.k.a. the resolution, plays an important role in the modeling and simulation process. Finally, the abstraction and resolution of the model determine the fidelity of the modeling and simulation, which becomes the ultimate utility for the model users. While abstraction, resolution and fidelity are the corner stones of the modeling and simulation discipline, they are often casually utilized. Moreover, their interplay is not investigated in-depth with explicit operationalization of the concepts. This article operationalizes the concept of abstraction, resolution, and fidelity by focusing on the aspect of model information.

  abstract = {Highway and street designers deal with the challenge of designing for a broad range of driver, vehicle, and roadway characteristics and conditions. There is significant variability in design inputs and design controls that influence design criteria and design decisions. This variability has traditionally been considered implicitly through selected values for geometric design parameters and criteria. Average values are used when the variability in the input design parameters is small. Conservative values are used if the variability is larger, often the case within the highway geometric design context. Previous research has demonstrated that addressing this variability and uncertainty more explicitly as part of design decisions can lead to better-informed and more cost-effective design decisions. Probabilistic design approaches that quantify both risk and reliability have been successfully incorporated into other design disciplines for those reasons. These approaches have also been explored in the highway geometric design literature and have shown promise. They are likely to be central to future performance-based design initiatives, as outlined in a recently published framework on conducting performance-based geometric design analysis. Given the emerging importance of performance-based design and the need to address challenges regarding the current method of handling variability and uncertainty in the input design parameters, this paper presents a collective review and assessment of methodological alternatives for quantifying risk and reliability associated with geometric design criteria and decisions.},

Increasing use of ``In-Vehicle Information Systems'' leads to driver distraction and is a contributing factor to many road accidents globally, and with systems for tickets, navigation, and timetables, bus drivers are more exposed to this additional workload than other actors in the traffic. This study provides insights into how bus drivers' driving behavior is affected by auditory traffic information through a driving simulator study at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute. A prestudy showed that many bus drivers in Gothenburg experience that a majority of the messages they receive are irrelevant to them. Difference in driving behavior was identified for conditions in which the drivers received messages irrelevant to their route, which might indicate that irrelevancy is an important factor for the workload imposed to the drivers. We hypothesize that irrelevant messages require processing in the visuospatial sketchpad, which might increase workload more than just auditory information processing. The results of this study implies that the routines for traffic communication between traffic controllers and bus drivers should be considerate, as to reduce the number of irrelevant messages that are cognitively loading the bus drivers.},

I recommend this to all software developers." - Rob Pacheco, Vision Government Solutions Grokking Simplicity is a friendly, practical guide that will change the way you approach software design and development.  Distributed across servers, difficult to test, and resistant to modification---modern software is complex. Grokking Simplicity is a friendly, practical guide that will change the way you approach software design and development. It introduces a unique approach to functional programming that explains why certain features of software are prone to complexity, and teaches you the functional techniques you can use to simplify these systems so that they're easier to test and debug.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.  About the technology Developers rightly fear the unintended complexity that infects most code. This book shows you how to write software that keeps complexity close to its inherent minimum. As you write software you should distinguish between code that alters your system's state, and code that does not. Once you learn to make that distinction, you can refactor much of your state-altering ``actions'' into stateless ``calculations.'' Your software will be simpler.  About the book The book also teaches you to solve the complex timing bugs that inevitably creep into asynchronous and multithreaded code. In ad\-vanced sections of the book you learn how composable abstractions help avoid repeating code and open up new levels of expressivity.  What's inside ~~~ Patterns for simpler code ~~~ Powerful time modeling approaches to simplify asynchronous code ~~~ How higher-order functions can make code reusable and composable  About the reader For intermediate and advanced developers building complex software.

  abstract = {The present study investigates the impact of different sources of task complexity such as driving demands and secondary task demands on driver behaviour. Although much research has been dedicated to understanding the impact of secondary task demands or specific road traffic environments on driving performance, there is little information on how drivers adapt their behaviour to their combined presence. This paper aims to describe driver behaviour while negotiating different sources of task complexity, including mobile phone use while driving (i.e., calling and texting) and different road environments (i.e., straight segments, curves, hills, tunnels, and curves on hills). A driving simulator experiment was conducted to explore the effects of different road scenarios and different types of distraction while driving. The collected data was used to estimate driving behaviour through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures. The analysis was divided into two phases. Phase one aimed to evaluate driver performance under the presence and absence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic, different lanes width and different types of distraction. The second phase analysed driver behaviour when driving through different road geometries and lane widths and under different types of distraction. The results of the experiment indicated that drivers are likely to overcorrect position in the vehicle lane in the presence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic. The effect of road geometry on driver behaviour was found to be greater than the effect of mobile phone distraction. Curved roads and hills were found to influence preferred speeds and lateral position the most. The results of this investigation also show that drivers under visual-manual distraction had a higher standard deviation of speed and lateral position compared to the cognitive distraction and the non-distraction condition.},

The architecture has been designed to enable the simulation of the entire network; as a result, the actual driver, pedestrian, and bike rider can navigate anywhere in the system. In addition, the background traffic interacts with the actual human beings.This is accomplished by using a hybrid mesomicroscopic traffic flowsimulationmodeling approach.Themesoscopic traffic flowsimulation model loads the results of a user equilibrium traffic assignment solution and propagates the corresponding traffic through the entire system.The microscopic traffic flow simulation model provides background traffic around the vicinities where actual human beings are navigating the system.The two traffic flow simulation models interact continuously to update system conditions based on the interactions between actual humans and the fully simulated entities. Implementation efforts are currently in progress and some preliminary tests of individual components have been conducted.Theimplementation of the proposed architecture faces significant challenges ranging from multiplatform and multilanguage integration to multievent communication and coordination.},

  abstract = {Study Objectives: To determine whether real-life driving would produce different effects from those obtained in a driving simulator on fatigue, performances and sleepiness. Design: Cross-over study involving real driving (1200 km) or simulated driving after controlled habitual sleep (8 hours) or restricted sleep (2 hours). Setting: Sleep laboratory and open French Highway. Participants: Twelve healthy men (mean age {\textpm} SD = 21.1 {\textpm} 1.6 years, range 19-24 years, mean yearly driving distance {\textpm} SD = 6563 {\textpm} 1950 miles) free of sleep disorders. Measurements: Self-rated fatigue and sleepiness, simple reaction time before and after each session, number of inappropriate line crossings from the driving simulator and from video-recordings of real driving. Results: Line crossings were more frequent in the driving simulator than in real driving (P {$<$} .001) and were increased by sleep deprivation in both conditions. Reaction times (10\% slowest) were slower during simulated driving (P = .004) and sleep deprivation (P = .004). Subjects had higher sleepiness scores in the driving simulator (P = .016) and in the sleep restricted condition (P = .001). Fatigue increased over time (P = .011) and with sleep deprivation (P = .000) but was similar in both driving conditions. Conclusions: Fatigue can be equally studied in real and simulated environments but reaction time and self-evaluation of sleepiness are more affected in a simulated environment. Real driving and driving simulators are comparable for measuring line crossings but the effects are of higher amplitude in the simulated condition. Driving simulator may need to be calibrated against real driving in various condition.},

  abstract = {This study analyzed factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving and its effects on driving performance, in terms of speed, lateral position, steer deviation, steer speed, following distance, perception--\- reaction time, and occurrence of a near miss situation. To investigate the factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving, 1106 respondents from four different regions in Thailand participated in the ques\- tionnaire survey study. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain these factors including two additional extended factors which are risk perception and law enforcement knowledge. The outcome of this part shows that attitude, norm, and law enforcement knowledge significantly affect the intention and behavior of the drivers. Even though approximately 90 percent of drivers realized that using a mobile phone while driving was dangerous and against the law, they have reported that they still use mobile phone while driving. To determine the effect of mobile phone use on driving performance, a 2-lane, straight rural highway, with a leading vehicle and an unexpected ``STOP'' sign, were simulated in order to examine the driving performance of drivers ``without a phone'', ``talking on a phone call'', and ``texting a message'' conditions. The results found that using mobile phone while driving can reduce speed and following distance, but increase lateral deviation, steer deviation, steer speed, perception-reaction time, and number of near misses leading to higher risks for road crashes.},

In the past, this was attributed to greater risk taking or poorly developed psychomotor skills. More recently, however, their high crash involvement rate has been hypothesized to be attributable largely to their relative inability to acquire and assess information in inherently risky situations. The current study seeks to evaluate this hypothesis by recording eye movements while 72 participants (24 novice drivers, 24 younger drivers, and 24 older drivers) drove through 16 risky scenarios in an advanced driving simulator. There were significant age-related differences in driver scanning behavior, consistent with the hypothesis that novice drivers' scanning patterns reflect their failure to acquire information about potential risks and their consequent failure to deal with these risks. Actual or potential applications of this research include modification of these scenarios for display on a PC as a basis for a training module that would enable novice drivers to recognize risky scenarios before they encounter them on the road, in the hope of reducing their high fatality rate.

Such updating is based on the ability to correctly estimate the speed and amplitude of body displacements. Because navigation in virtual worlds often relies on the sole visual information, we investigated to which extent the size of the field of view (FoV) affects two basic aspects of motion perception: (i) the perceived amplitude of rotations about the body vertical axis (Experiment 1) and (ii) the perceived speed of forward translations (Experiment 2).},

  abstract = {In the first experiment we investigated the effect of reduced visibility on the produced speed in a driving simulation. Participants were required to drive at a target speed of 90 km/h in different visibility conditions. We found that when realistic fog was simulated, the driving speed was reduced accordingly to the fog density. When a uniform reduction of the image contrast was implemented, no effects were observed on the produced speed. We speculated that fog reduces selectively the visibility of the distant region of the scene and leaves visible only the proximal area that contains high angular velocities. We hypothesized that the perceived speed is then biased by the available raw velocity signals from the visual field. In the second experiment we addressed the question whether the observed behavioral effect has indeed a perceptual origin. In a psychophysical task we asked the participants to estimate the speed of moving scenes when the sight was limited either to the periphery (high angular velocities) or to the center (low angular velocities) of the field of view. According to our hypothesis, we found that when the central region was occluded, the speed at the periphery was perceived as being higher, and conversely, when the peripheral region was missing the speed at the center was perceived as being lower. We conclude that the speed reduction while driving in fog is due to a non-optimal perceptual compensation for the hidden central region with low angular velocities, which causes an overestimation of the driving speed.},

  abstract = {Previous investigation has revealed that diverging maneuvers along curved terminals lead to a deterioration in the longitudinal and transversal performances of drivers with respect to linear ones. As a countermeasure, innovative horizontal markings (HMs) may be used to compel drivers to drive more prudently and maintain better vehicle control. In this driving simulation study, the behavioral effects of alternative HMs along curved exit ramp terminals were investigated. Forty-eight voluntary participants drove along randomly assigned exit ramp terminals, the design of which involved combinations of the following input variables: (i) horizontal markings (standard HM1, with internal lane bands HM2, with external zebra stripes HM3); (ii) lighting conditions (day and night); (iii) traffic flow in the motorway (1,000 passenger cars per hour pc/h and 3,000 pc/h), and (iv) ramp terminal connection type (continuous and reverse). Longitudinal (i.e., speed) and transversal (i.e., lateral position and diverging abscissa) behavioral data were collected. HM2 leads to greater improvements in the level of road safety thanks to better longitudinal and transversal driver behavior. However, drivers did delay their exit from the motorway with respect to the baseline condition (HM1) independent of the connection type. No relevant improvements were observed with HM3, apart from speed reductions at the end of the terminal and more centered trajectories when approaching the ramp. Results also show that drivers tended to enter the reverse terminal later than the continuous one (where drivers correctly used the taper), thus revealing that the use of the innovative HMs was not able to compensate for this inappropriate behavior adopted along reverse terminals.},

Method: This study used a driving simulator to determine the effect that easy and difficult cell phone conversations have on driving performance. Results: Cell phone use caused participants to have higher variation in accelerator pedal position, drive more slowly with more variation in speed, and report a higher level of workload regardless of conversation difficulty level. Conclusions: Drivers may cope with the additional stress of phone conversations by enduring higher workloads or setting reduced performance goals. Impact on Industry: Because an increasing number of people talk on the phone while driving, crashes caused by distracted drivers using cell phones will cause disruptions in business, as well as injury, disability, and permanent loss of personnel. {\copyright} 2004 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

This review presents the current state of research methods, theories, and known aspects associated with cybersickness. Current measurements of incidence of cybersickness are questionnaires, postural sway, and physiological state. Varying effects due to display and rendering modes, such as visual display type and stereoscopic or monoscopic rendering, are compared. The known and suspected application aspects that induce cybersickness are discussed. There are numerous potential contributing application design aspects, many of which have had limited study, but field of view and navigation are strongly correlated with cybersickness. The effect of visual displays is not well understood, and application design may be of greater importance.},

Six men and six women drove a freeway route while periodically dialling simulated phone calls. The same subjects drove a laboratory driving simulator using two visual fidelity levels: a colour scene with relatively high detail, and a monochrome (night) scene showing only road-edge markings. Lane position, speed, steering-wheel angle and throttle position were recorded in both contexts. Lane-keeping in the simulator was less precise than on the road, but speed control performance was comparable. The SD of lane position in normal driving was about twice as large, on average, in the simulator (0.360 versus 0.165 m). Lane keeping and speed control were less precise when dialling the phone than in normal driving, both in the simulator and on the road, but the performance decrement was greater in the simulator. The addition of the phone task increased the mean lateral speed in the car by about 43\%, while in the simulator the mean lateral speed increased by 158\% with the addition of the phone task. Subjects {$>$} 60 years of age showed larger performance decrements during a concurrent phone dialling task than did subjects 20 - 30 years of age both in the simulator and on-road. No important differences in driving performance were found between the high and low simulator scene fidelity levels. The simulator demonstrated good absolute validity for measures of speed control and good relative validity for the effects of the phone task and age on driving precision.},

  abstract = {Harsh decelerations and abrupt lane changes of drivers on the outer expressway lane in response to merging platoon vehicles from on-ramps increase the crash- and congestion risk on expressways. Several merge control approaches are worldwide implemented. However, there is a gap in knowledge which driving behaviors determine whether a particular merge control approach is best for a rural or urban expressway. This study tests a number of dynamic merge control strategies, such as lane control signalization (eventually combined with variable speed limits (VSL), on a 4-lane urban and rural expressway to measure the behavioral responses of drivers being directly exposed to platoon merging from on-ramps. Subsequently, a comparison was made with the driving behaviors in response to static merge control (e.g. merge warning signs or road marking treatment). The driving behavior of 66 drivers from the State of Qatar was recorded in a driving simulator and analyzed by means of a within-subject repeated measures analysis with univariate statistics. The results suggest that dynamic merge control is more effective for rural expressways considering the higher traffic speeds. The earlier lane changes contributed to smooth maneuvers and gradual speed reductions on the rural expressway and improved safe driving behavior as compared to static merge control. In contrast, the dynamic merge control did not deliver additional safety benefits on urban expressways and can be substituted by a low-cost static merge control approach. Policymakers aiming to improve traffic safety at expressway merging sections are advised to take the speed characteristics of the local expressway into account before implementing dynamic merge control.},

This paper presents a study that used a professional racing simulator to compare the behavior of human and autonomous drivers under an aggressive driving scenario. A professional simulator offers a close-to-real emulation of underlying physics and vehicle dynamics, as well as a wealth of clean telemetry data. In the first study, the participants' task was to achieve the fastest lap while keeping the car on the track. We grouped the resulting laps according to the performance (lap-time), defining driving behaviors at various performance levels. An extensive analysis of vehicle control features obtained from telemetry data was performed with the goal of predicting the driving performance and informing an autonomous system. In the second part of the study, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm was trained to control the brake, throttle and steering of the simulated racing car. We investigated how the features used to predict driving performance in humans can be used in autonomous driving. Our study investigates human driving patterns with the goal of finding traces that could improve the performance of RL approaches. Conversely, they can also be applied to training (professional) drivers to improve their racing line.},

A challenge for using driving simulators as a research tool has been to elicit driving behaviour that equals real world driving. With respect to driver headways few studies have made a direct comparison between behaviour in real and virtual environments. The present study compared driver headway choice in a driving simulator and in an instrumented vehicle. Twenty-two participants carried out instructions to either change their headway to a specific value or to choose a headway as they would normally do. The speed of the lead vehicle (80, 100 or 120 km/h) as well as the target headway (1, 1.5, 2 s) were varied between trials. Specific headway instructions were provided in seconds as well as metres. The attained headways were compared between the virtual and the real environment. Results show no significant difference between headway choice in the simulator and on a real road, neither for self-chosen nor for instructed headways. The results provide support for the use of driving simulators in studies on headway choice.},

  abstract = {This driving simulator study investigated differences in the influence of lane width reduction on speed profiles and lateral positions in real-world and simulator conditions. The use of driving simulators has been expanding in transportation research. This use raises the question of the simulators' validity. The study was developed in two steps. In the first step, an experiment was conducted with the INRETS (French National Institute for Transport and Safety Research) driving simulator. Fortythree drivers drove in the simulator. Two configurations of lane widths (3.5 m and 3 m) were tested, both chosen in reference to a previous French field study carried out on a rural road to assess the impact of lane width reduction and the provision of a hard shoulder on driver behaviors (speed, lateral positioning). In the second step, results were compared with the results of the French field study. The comparison showed that, as in the field study, reducing the lane width had no impact on speeds but did induce the participants to drive closer to the center of the road. It also showed that oncoming vehicles induced subjects to move toward the right side of their lanes. Finally, the results showed a relative behavioral validity.},

Forty-two participants had to drive on two road environments: a 3 km straight road with a crest vertical curve (CVC) with perceptual treatments and narrowed lane width with subsequent provision of a hard shoulder, by relocation of the road markings. The results showed that, on the one hand the lateral position variability was greater when driving on the test CVC, before meeting oncoming vehicle and on the narrowed lane width; and on the other hand it was limited according to the perceptual treatment used. The lateral position variability would be a difficulty indicator of road geometry which would inform road managers of the presence of a risk zone on their road network.},

A selection of 11 commercial video games, previously considered in safety researches, was used to build and test a Driving Experience Analysis -- Rating Grid (DEA-RG). Levels of ``environmental realism'', ``driving realism'' and ``accident realism'' were assessed. DEA-RG scores showed that different categories of racing games generate very different user's experiences in driving simulations, with mixed levels of realism even within game-categories previously considered as homogenous. Implications for video game developers and road-safety researchers are discussed, for more systematic research hypothesis.},

We propose a model of steering that explicitly embodies this idea, using both a 'near point' to maintain a central lane position and a 'far point' to account for the upcoming roadway. Unlike control models that integrate near and far information to compute curvature or more complex features, our model relies solely on one perceptually plausible feature of the near and far points, namely the visual direction to each point. The resulting parsimonious model can be run in simulation within a realistic highway environment to facilitate direct comparison between model and human behavior. Using such simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed two-point model is able to account for four interesting aspects of steering behavior: curve negotiation with occluded visual regions, corrective steering after a lateral drift, lane changing, and individual differences.},

Results showed that for gross effects on performance indicators, aspects of lateral position control in the laboratory test gave a sufficient first indication of sizeable influence as soon as visual attention was diverted towards the secondary task. More subtle differences between levels of visual search difficulty were only found in the simulator and in the field. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

How realistic must driving simulations be to discriminate different categories of impaired drivers? Highend, high-fidelity, immersive simulators are expensive and unsuited for general use, whereas standardized neuropsychological (i.e. paper and pencil) tests have had mixed success in predicting driver fitness. Consequently, we designed a low-cost, PC-based, abstract virtual environment (VE) for assessing cognitively impaired drivers. Instead of striving for visual realism, the VE provides abstract representations of necessary visual cues in a single screen. The VE captures key elements of real-time driving in driving-like scenarios generated with flexible, usable, and cost effective PC software. This software comprises a suite of tools for testing cognitive functions engaged by driving tasks, such Go No-Go decision making and the ability to ignore irrelevant driving distracters ("mudsplashes"). Pilot studies in several dozen subjects show that the VE tools discriminate between drivers with neurocognitive disorders (e.g, Alzheimer's disease, executive dysfunction from frontal lobe lesions) and older comparison drivers without cognitive impairment. Moreover, no drivers showed simulator adaptation syndrome or dropped out of pilot studies due to discomfort. We are comparing VE task performances with real world driving outcomes.},

This study assessed how increasing this field of view would affect hazard perception abilities. Drivers were shown video clips of driving situations containing at least one hazard either on a single screen, or with the addition of side views on two separate but adjacent screens that extended the perceived worldview to approximately 180{\textopenbullet}. Mirror information was also included to allow information from behind the vehicle to be attended. Participants were instructed to press a button as soon as they saw a hazard. Faster response times were found for hazards that appeared in the centre of the central screen, than in the periphery of the central screen, with hazards that first appeared in the lateral screens responded to slowest. Additionally, responses to the hazards were faster and were more likely to occur in the three-, as compared to the single-screen condition. These results suggest that providing participants with a wider field of view, which includes more environmental cues that are related to the relevant hazardous situation increases their ability to detect hazards, and some limited support to that providing them with a wider view increases this ability even when all hazard-relevant information appear only in the central screen. A number of reasons for the three-screen advantage are discussed. This study suggests that even responses to central hazards may be under-estimated in a typical single-screen hazard perception test, and that improvements can be made for new hazard perception tests, by including visual information from the side and from behind the driver. This new methodology not only allows testing hazard perception skills in a potentially more immersive and realistic environment, but also enables to create hazard perception clips that cannot be realised in a typical single-screen test.},

In Experiment 1, car drivers and motorcyclists received a questionnaire which consisted of short descriptions of the scenarios used in the simulator. Half of the car drivers and half of the motorcyclists were told to imagine they were driving a car through the scenario. The other halves were told to imagine they were riding a motorcycle. Respondents with the mindset of a motorcyclist rated the scenarios as more realistic than respondents with a car driver's mindset. Real-life riders however reported the scenarios as more dangerous than real-life drivers, suggesting that their specific motorcycle experience influenced their criterion for danger. In Experiment 2, na{\"i}ve participants navigated a simulated route with the same hazards. Performance was coded on objective (e.g., crashes) and subjective (e.g., riding safety and skill) criteria. Experiential differences on some of the measures (and the absence of such differences on other measures) suggest that the simulator is useful for distinguishing riders from drivers during safe periods of riding but not necessarily during hazardous periods of riding. The implications of why hazard vignettes discriminate but the same simulated hazards do not are discussed, with emphasis on the crucial elements required to design a successful simulated hazard. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In most situations, vehicles on these rural roads are of free traffic flow, and the driving stability of a vehicle is therefore mostly influenced by alignments and road surface. Single-vehicle run-off-road crashes are often associated with poor road conditions. Therefore, the improvement of alignment design of the roads can be effective to reduce the number of traffic accidents. This research targets at the analysis of driving in several sections of a four-class rural road in Yunan province, China, with varying alignments and complex shapes. In this context, a road creation module, a vehicle dynamics model, and driver module are established in computing environment, and integrated into a "roadway-driver-vehicle" virtual driving system. Driving simulations of a passenger car model on the test segments are conducted. Speed, driver workload, and ride comfort are analyzed in relation to varying geometric alignments. The simulation results show that: by balancing the design parameters of adjacent curve radii and the tangent length in-between, critical safety driving speed on lower standard rural roads can be obtained; the use of hairpin curves and the absence of spirals would lead to a rapid increase in both angular speed of steering wheel and lateral acceleration change rate, resulting in increasing driver nervousness and passenger discomfort.},

The findings indicate that not only do we lack data from which to derive an accurate numerical estimate, but we lack a measurement system within which any numerical estimate would be meaningful. Consequently, although the information relevant to driving is likely to be predominantly visual, any claims about the precise percentage attributable to vision are premature. The proliferation of such claims in the absence of direct evidence is a reminder that researchers should be careful about assuring the validity of the claims they are passing on.},

  abstract = {A crash avoidance database structure that is based on driver judgments is proposed. The structure comprises four driving conflict states (low risk, conflict, near crash, and crash) that correspond with advisory warning, crash-imminent warning, and crash mitigation counter-measures. The feasibility of this database structure is investigated by answering two questions: (a) Can the driving states be reliably quantified? and (b) Can the quantified states be used to create a useful crash avoidance database? The feasibility discussion centers on a specific dynamic scenario that involved braking maneuvers by a following vehicle to avoid a rear-end crash with a stopped lead vehicle. The quantification of driver judgment data from a controlled test track study is discussed as a foundation to identify rough quantitative locations for the conflict and near-crash state transitions, and crash data from a driving simulator experiment are used to estimate the crash state boundary. A database of on-road, naturalistic driving data is compared with the controlled experiments to evaluate the results. The method is found to be feasible, and recommendations for further development are presented.},

Two simulator experiments were executed using convenience samples of young drivers who completed a simulated drive and a questionnaire that quantified their experience playing video games. In the first experiment, participants completed a comprehensive simulated driving assessment where composite indicators of overall driving performance were collected. In the second experiment, participants completed a simulated driving scenario specifically designed to assess drivers' handling abilities. The results showed a statistically significant association between video game experience and measures of speed and crash only in the handling scenario that participants completed in the second experiment. The results suggest that video game experience contributes to simulated driving behaviour through its relationship with risk taking behaviours among young drivers. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The integration of the two simulators will enhance the ability of both traffic modeling and driving simulation and present a new area of applications.

As a connected multi-user framework that allows multiple drivers who are simultaneously handling many driving simulators, it not only allows driver behavior experiments to be more accurate, controlled, and versatile but also simulates special driving behavior or multi-vehicle interactions under more realistic traffic flow environments. To validate the performance of TSMDS, 27 drivers were recruited to attend the lane changing experiments at a recurring on-ramp bottleneck and left-turn experiments at a two-phase signalized intersection in Shanghai. Both experiments required several drivers to drive the TSMDS and fulfill several complicated lane changing/crossing behaviors through their interaction. The results show that both the participants' response and lane changing/crossing data that were obtained from the experiment are consistent with the field observation, which confirms the validity of the integrated platform.},

The architecture is based on the vertical and crosswise algorithm of ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics. In the proposed architecture grouping of the bits 4 at a time is done for both the multiplicand and multiplier. Thus the whole multiplication operation is decomposed into 4x4 bit multiplication modules. The 4x4 multiplication modules can be implemented by using any multiplier such as array, booth, wallace or future proposed efficient multiplier. It has been demonstrated that implementing the array and booth multiplier as 4x4 modules in the proposed architecture leads to a considerable improvement in their efficiency. Due to its efficient performance, the overlay architecture is a boon for DSP applications such as multimedia and image processing. In order to test the effect of further decomposition of the bits on the efficiency of the architecture, the 4x4 multiply module are further decomposed into parallel 2x2 multiply modules by grouping two bits at a time for both 4 bit multiplicand and multiplier. The results has shown that decomposition nearly reaches a saturation level in its efficiency at 4x4 decomposition and further decomposition has a not a significant improvement in the architecture efficiency .},

Interfaces offering high fidelity and immersion can more closely reproduce real-world experiences and are generally believed to result in better learning outcomes. However, absolute fidelity in stress training is not critical for skills to be transferable. The present study compared the performance outcomes achieved by trainees using two different simulator types to complete a training program aimed at improving decision-making skills. The purpose of this research was to assess both the overall level of training effectiveness and to determine whether performance levels were influenced when high (160 degree curved wide screen) versus low fidelity (small cab-based flat screen) simulator types were in use. Sixty-three train drivers drove for 40min on a simulated track on which they encountered four major high stress driving events. One year later, 42 of the original drivers returned and repeated the training scenario a second and third time. Results revealed trainees using the lower fidelity flat screen simulator made fewer errors in both years than trainees using the high fidelity curved screen simulator. The implications of these results are discussed. {\copyright} 2010 Taylor \& Francis.},

Research-based driving simulators have emerged as a safe, convenient way to assess driving performance after a stroke. Such traditional research simulators are useful in recreating street traffic scenarios, but are often expensive, with limited physics models and graphics rendering. In contrast, racing simulators developed for motorsport professionals and enthusiasts offer high levels of realism, run on consumer-grade hardware, and can provide rich telemetric data. However, most offer limited simulation of traffic scenarios. This pilot study compares the feasibility of research simulation and racing simulation in a sample with minor stroke. We determine that the racing simulator is tolerated well in subjects with a minor stroke. There were correlations between research and racing simulator outcomes with psychometric tests associated with driving performance, such as the Trails Making Test Part A, Snellgrove Maze Task, and the Motricity Index. We found correlations between measures of driving speed on a complex research simulator scenario and racing simulator lap time and maximum tires off track. Finally, we present two models, using outcomes from either the research or racing simulator, predicting road test failure as linked to a previously published fitness-to-drive calculator that uses psychometric screening.},

Speed and lateral position of 20 subjects were measured in a real tunnel and in the same tunnel implemented in the VTI driving simulator. In both situations a left-hand steered and manually geared passenger car was used. Driving speed was higher in the simulated tunnel than in the real tunnel. Elimination of speed information from the speedometer caused a similar small speed increase in both situations. Also, the difference in speed between driving lanes was similar in both cases. The effects on speed variation were similar to that for speed level. Regarding lateral position, subjects positioned the car somewhat further away from the nearest tunnel wall in the real tunnel than in the simulated tunnel. In both situations the distance to the nearest wall was greater when it was located to the left of the driver than on the opposite side. Lateral position deviation was about the same when the road was straight, but in a curved section it was somewhat greater for the simulated tunnel. It is concluded that behavioural validity in absolute terms was not quite satisfactory, especially regarding choice of speed, whereas relative validity was good for both speed and lateral position. {\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

That is, the optimized repetition of the same geometry or module, for the generation of large virtual environments for the simulators that are designed by CITEF. The current trend is on redirecting the maximum possible share of graphical calculation to the GPU to lighten the load of the CPU as far as possible, as this is slower and less suitable for graphic calculation. Modular Technology, which has been successfully used for some time in driving training simulators, is particularly suitable for the implementation of operations in the GPU through programming shaders. In this way a substantial reduction in the number of geographical entities in the environment can be attained and an increase in the diversity and flexibility of the environment. This is achieved by discretizing the environment into a series of instantiated modules and using shaders in an appropriate manner based only on a few parameters. There are many advantages to be had from this form of generation: savings in scene size, loading times and resource requirements, greater flexibility and clarity of the scene graph and a more substantial upgrade capacity of the environment.},

To evaluate a driving simulator here we compare hazard detection while driving on roads, while watching short film clips recorded from a vehicle moving through traffic, and while driving through a simulated city in a fully instrumented fixed-base simulator with a 90 degree forward view (plus mirrors) that is under the speed/direction control of the driver. In all three situations we find increased scanning by more experienced and especially professional drivers, and earlier eye fixations on hazardous objects for experienced drivers. This comparability encourages the use of simulators in drivers training and testing. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The driving simulator study served as a means to include human factor principles into roadside infrastructure guidelines. Roadside features studied included trees, guardrails, barriers, panels, and emergency lanes. It was found that drivers tended to move away laterally from safety barriers when they first approached them and that they slightly slowed down. The type and size of a safety barrier appeared to be less important; only its presence had an effect. Trees were not found to affect the speed of the driver unless they were close (2 m) to the road edge on a rural road with an 80-km/h speed limit, and this effect faded rather quickly. There was no influence on speed if the trees were more than 4.5 m from the lane edge. The fact that trees along the road are not considered to be a hazard, with drivers not adjusting their behavior, makes trees even more dangerous.},

Additionally, both groups completed a choice reaction time task and a tracking task. Results from the sim- ulator showed faster lap times, higher steering activity, and a more optimal racing line for the racing drivers than for the non-racing drivers. The non-racing drivers' gaze behavior corre- sponded to the tangent point model, whereas racing drivers showed a more variable gaze behavior combined with larger head rotations while cornering. Results from the choice reac- tion time task and tracking task showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

Based on rigorous experiments carried over a period of two years and multiple surveys, we have tried to learn the problems faced by the bus commuters. As a solution, in this work, we develop a novel energy efficient system which would help commuters navigate through their journey safely. Along with making them aware of any upcoming points of concerns (PoC) like sudden bumps, sharp turns, bad roads etc, we also inform commuters about the expected time of arrival at the destination. The system makes use of several landmarks like speed breakers, turns and bus stops on a trail stored in a specialized data structure, the probabilistic timed automata. We conducted extensive experiments using 25 volunteers over 50 trails. The system showed an average localization error of only 50m and mean ETA error of 2.5 minutes and a fairly high alert prediction accuracy, while consuming significantly less energy when compared to GPS.},

There is a dearth of research, however, on how geometric design characteristics, especially complex alignments and their adjacent segments, affect deceleration and acceleration. The Tongji University driving simulator was used to collect vehicle operation data. Deceleration and acceleration values were measured and classified as deceleration, near-cruising and acceleration. A random parameter multinomial logistic regression model was used to reflect the relationships between drivers' deceleration and acceleration and the geometric alignments of a mountainous freeway. Vehicle speed was treated as a random slope parameter to account for the heterogeneity among subjects. Model results showed deceleration and acceleration were significantly influenced by the fixed effects of maximum curvature in the following 50\,m, difference between maximum and minimum slope in the preceding 100\,m, maximum slope change in the following 400\,m, and maximum curvature in the preceding 50\,m. These findings can assist in developing safer design and evaluation standards for mountainous freeways.},

This study examines speed changes on four types of combined curves: downslope, upslope, crest and sag. From design blueprints for a mountainous freeway under construction in Hunan Province, a total of 70 combined curves were programmed into the Tongji University driving simulator. Study participants drove through the simulated freeway while vehicle operation data was continuously captured. Speed changes on the combined curves were determined by calculating the differences between minimum and maximum speed values, and were classified into three behaviors: substantial speed decrease, steady speed (minimal change), and substantial speed increase. Multinomial logit models were used and the marginal effects of each variable were calculated in order to examine the effects on speed change behavior of each combined curve type and their adjacent segments. Results show that: 1) the speed change behaviors on the four types of combined curves differ in frequency, 2) the significant effects of geometric design characteristics on speed change differed by type of combined curve, and 3) design characteristics of adjacent segments also have significant and varying effects on speed change. Combined curves should therefore be studied separately, and their adjacent segments should be considered when combined curves are planned.},

Despite their frequent use in research, there is relatively little evidence confirming their validity (i.e., how accurately they represent or reproduce real-world driving). Moreover, there is inconsistency in both the types of simulators used, and the operationalisation of ``real-world'' driving in validations. This systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the evidence regarding driving simulator accuracy when compared with real-world driving. The review included 44 studies reporting a direct comparison between simulated driving and on-road driving in a vehicle. Measures reported for comparison varied but included mean speed, speed variability, lateral position, overall driving performance, and number of driving errors. Simulators in approximately half of the studies achieved absolute or relative validity, whereas one third produced non-valid results. To understand this further, the fidelity of simulators was considered, however this further clouded our understanding as the relationship between simulator fidelity and validity was not straightforward. The findings suggest that the reporting of driving simulator studies requires improvement, particularly around the validation evidence associated with the simulator, the specific details of the simulated driving environment, and the outputs of statistical analyses. Guidelines are proposed for future research to ensure consistency in the conduct, and reporting, of simulator-based research.},

In simulator experiment, secondary tasks, including cognitive, visual and manual tasks, were performed in a driving simulator. Subjective rating was used to test mental workload of drivers in on-road test and simulator experiment. The impact of task complexity and reaction mode was investigated in this paper. The results of the test and the simulation showed that position 1 was more comfortable than other two positions for drivers and it would cause less mental load. Drivers tend to support this result in subjective rating. IVIS with voice prompt causes less visual demand to drivers. The mental load will grow as the difficulty of the task increasing. The cognitive task on manual reaction causes higher mental load than cognitive task which doesn't require manual reaction. These results may have practical implications for in-vehicle information system design.},

  abstract = {Objective: Speed compliance of drivers plays a significant role in influencing crash risks, and remains a major road safety issue. Majority of the speed compliance behavioral studies have been conducted in the western world; relatively little knowledge is available about the speed compliance of the drivers of developing nations. The present study aims to investigate the speed compliance behavior of Indian drivers in changing driving environment, and to identify the significant predictors influencing their speed compliance. Method: The driving scenario (consisting of rural and urban driving environments) representing heterogenous Indian driving conditions was designed on a driving simulator where eighty-two licensed drivers completed the driving task. Driver attributes (demographics and driving characteristics) were recorded with the help of a self-reported questionnaire. Speed compliance of drivers was estimated as an indication of the difference of driving speed from the posted speed limit of a particular driving environment, averaged over the duration of driving. The low speed difference indicated better speed compliance of drivers and vice-versa. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was developed using speed difference as the dependent variable along with driving environments and driver attributes as predictor variables. Results: Speed compliance of drivers was found to be better in urban driving environment compared to rural driving environment, indicating that drivers were less able to adapt to the corresponding speed limits in rural environment. Drivers' age was positively associated with the speed compliance. For male drivers, speed compliance was found to be lower than the female drivers. Compared to the drivers who studied till their secondary education, speed compliances of postgraduate and graduate drivers were found to be better. Moreover, driving experience was observed as a negative predictor of speed compliance. Drivers who had prior crash history were found to have better speed compliance compared to the other drivers. Other predictors such as vehicle type and preferred time of driving did not show any significant influence on the speed compliance of drivers. Conclusion: This is the first exploratory study which investigated the speed compliance behavior of Indian drivers. Findings of the present study may assist the road safety strategies and policy interventions in reducing the speed-related crashes.},

  abstract = {Real risk status detection is an effective way to reflect risky or dangerous driving behaviors and therefore to prevent road traffic accidents. However, a driver's risk status is not only difficult to define but also uncontrollable and uncertain. In this study, a simulated experiment with 30 drivers was conducted using a driving simulator to collect the multi-sensor data of road conditions, humans, and vehicles. The driving risk status was classified into three states (0 - incident, 1 - near crash, or 2 - crash) on the basis of the playback system of the driving simulator. The experimental data were pre-processed using the cubic spline interpolation method and the time-windows theory. A driving risk status identification model was established using the C5.0 decision tree algorithm, and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was adopted to evaluate the performance of the identification model. The results indicated that respiration (RESP), vehicle speed (SPE), SM\_FATIGUE, distance to the left lane (LLD), course angle (CA), and skin conductivity (SC) had a significant correlation (p {$<$} 0.05) with the driving risk status. The identification accuracy of the C5.0 decision tree algorithm was 78\%, and the areas under the ROC were 0.934, 0.77, and 0.845, respectively. Moreover, compared with other four identification algorithms, the algorithm performance evaluation indexes TPR (0.780), precision (0.753), recall (0.78), F-measure (0.756), and kappa (0.884) of the C5.0 decision tree were all the best. The conclusion can provide reference evidence for danger warning systems and intelligent vehicle design.},

In support of the research objective, this simulator validity study was conducted from two perspectives, a traffic parameter (speed) and a safety parameter (crash history). A signalized intersection with as many important features (including roadway geometries, traffic control devices, intersection surroundings, and buildings) was replicated into a high-fidelity driving simulator. A driving simulator experiment with eight scenarios at the intersection were conducted to determine if the subjects' speed behavior and traffic risk patterns in the driving simulator were similar to what were found at the real intersection. The experiment results showed that speed data observed from the field and in the simulator experiment both follow normal distributions and have equal means for each intersection approach, which validated the driving simulator in absolute terms. Furthermore, this study used an innovative approach of using surrogate safety measures from the simulator to contrast with the crash analysis for the field data. The simulator experiment results indicated that compared to the right-turn lane with the low rear-end crash history record (2 crashes), subjects showed a series of more risky behaviors at the right-turn lane with the high rear-end crash history record (16 crashes), including higher deceleration rate (1.80 {\textpm} 1.20 m/s2 versus 0.80 {\textpm} 0.65 m/s2), higher non-stop right-turn rate on red (81.67\% versus 57.63\%), higher right-turn speed as stop line (18.38 {\textpm} 8.90 km/h versus 14.68 {\textpm} 6.04 km/h), shorter following distance (30.19 {\textpm} 13.43 m versus 35.58 {\textpm} 13.41 m), and higher rear-end probability (9/59 = 0.153 versus 2/60 = 0.033). Therefore, the relative validity of driving simulator was well established for the traffic safety studies at signalized intersections. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have seen considerable growth in computer capabilities, data collection technology and communication mediums. This growth has had considerable impact on our ability to replicate driver behaviour and understand the processes involved in failures in the traffic system. From time to time it is necessary to assess the level of development as a basis of determining how far we have come. This paper sets out to assess the state of the art in the use of computer models to simulate and assess the level of safety in existing and future traffic systems. It reviews developments in the area of road safety simulation models. In particular, it reviews computer models of driver and vehicle behaviour within a road context. It focuses on stochastic numerical models of traffic behaviour and how reliable these are in estimating levels of safety on the traffic network. Models of this type are commonly used in the assessment of traffic systems for capacity, delay and general performance. Adding safety to this assessment regime may allow more comprehensive assessment of future traffic systems. To date the models have focused primarily on vehicular traffic that is, cars and heavy vehicles. It has been shown that these models have potential in measuring the level of conflict on parts of the network and the measure of conflict correlated well with crash statistics. Interest in the prediction of crashes and crash severity is growing and new models are focusing on the continuum of general traffic conditions, conflict, severe conflict, crash and severe crashes. The paper also explores the general data types used to develop, calibrate and validate these models. Recent technological development in in-vehicle data collection, driver simulators and machine learning offers considerable potential for improving the behavioural base, rigour and application of road safety simulation models. The paper closes with some indication of areas of future development. {\copyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Fidelity has been a critical concern of researchers throughout the history of driving simulation. Understanding the limits of a driving simulation system is a prerequisite for conducting valid driving simulator studies. This paper proposes a novel and interdisciplinary methodology to ensure validity of studies using driving simulators (primarily for traffic control devices and other object detection tasks) based on the visual limits of human sensory and perceptual capabilities, and the characteristics of raster graphics. This methodology decomposes the perceptual issues of a stimulus into perceptual issues of different visual properties like luminance, hue, or text of the stimulus. By systematically analyzing the mechanism of human vision in driving simulators, the perceptual principle is proposed to ensure perceivable visual details in human-in-the-loop driving simulation systems. Additionally, the graphic principle is proposed to ensure perceivable features of a target object in the virtual driving environment. Both principles quantify the minimum requirements of visual fidelity with two measurements: angular resolution and matrix dimensions. The enriched results from existing pertinent studies are analyzed and organized to yield support of both principles. This research focuses on the minimum requirements for four factors; namely the visual acuity of drivers, the specifications of display systems, the configurations of graphics systems, and the design of virtual scenarios, as well as the relationship among all these factors to assess the visual fidelity in driving simulation systems. Within the realm of human perception, this work can provide criteria for proper design, calibration, and usage of driving simulators.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The majority of accidents involving personal injury occur in urban intersections. As human error is the primary cause of these accidents, it seems reasonable to support drivers by intersection assistants. Studies to evaluate such systems are usually performed in driving simulators. However, this implies driver behaviour validity, which cannot always be taken for granted due to the artificial nature of simulated environments. The paper pays special attention to the validity of braking behaviour in urban intersections. In particular, the effect of the test scenario and selected driving simulator design parameters is considered. Method: The Time to Intersection (TTI) time interval between field and simulator study was evaluated at five simple urban intersections. Results: Independently of the type of intersection and the parameter configuration of the simulator, subjects initiated braking in preparation for a turning manoeuvre significantly earlier in the field than in the driving simulator. In particular, the results of both tests differed more at intersections where the driver did not have right of way than at intersections with other layouts, confirming the impact of the test scenario. Some differences were also found when the driving simulator parameter set was varied. Conclusions: The braking behaviour near urban intersections differs between real and simulated experimental environments. From these results, we conclude that caution is required when designing intersection assistance systems based solely on the braking behaviour of subjects in simulated environments. The test scenario and the design parameters must be considered as factors which influence the results. Practical applications: Depending on the current traffic situation and interactions, multiple different kinds of accident can occur at the considered types of intersection, meaning that closely investigating the driver behaviour validity at these junctions is highly important for further intersection assistance systems. Validity of TTI is for example important when determining the best choice of warning interval for a turning assistance system. {\'O} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
